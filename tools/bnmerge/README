BNMERGE is a tool to merge the output files produced by BFM_NEMO when run
in parallel. It is controlled by the namelist bnmerge.nml through the
following parameters:

out_fname 	string 	Name of NetCDF output files "out_fname_????.nc"
out_dir 	string 	Path to the output files
layout 	  	string 	Path to the layout.dat file

as for instance 

&bfm_nml
   out_fname='PELAGOS_ORCA2'
   out_dir='/path/to/output'
   layout = '/path/to/layout.dat'
/

The output files are remapped from the 1D BFM grid to the 3D NEMO grid.
All variables are copied and the output file contains also the Tmask and
lat lon arrays.
