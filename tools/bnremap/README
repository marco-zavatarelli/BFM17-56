BNREMAP is a tool to remap the 1D output files produced by BFM_NEMO 
and produce an output on the 3D ocean grid.
This tool works on output file containing the whole ocean domain.
Use BNMERGE instead to merge sub-domains from a parallel simulation.
This program can also be used with data produced by PELAGOS V1.0.
It is controlled by the namelist bnremap.nml through the
following parameters:
in_fname         string        Path to NetCDF input file
out_fname        string        Path to NetCDF input file
mesh_flag        logical       If true reads mesh info from file meshmask
meshmask         string        Path to meshmask file
old_version      logical       To read old PELAGOS1.0 output files

as for instance 

&bnremap_nml
   in_fname='/path/to/input.nc'
   out_fname='/path/to/output.nc'
   mesh_flag = .TRUE.
   meshmask='path/to/meshmask.nc'
   old_version = .FALSE.
/

All variables are copied and the output file contains also the tmask and
lat lon arrays.
