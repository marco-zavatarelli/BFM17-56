This code computes the chlorophyll concentration as seen by satellite
considering: 
1. the optical depth and a tolerance level as described in Vichi et al. (2007), eq. 2 
2. the 1% light level
3. the 0.1% light level

Input files are the chlorophyll concentration (variable Chla) and the attenuation coefficient
(variable xEPS), both with the same number of time stamps, and the mask file.
It also allows to compute the attenuation coefficient using the BFM formula from Chl
concentration, background attenuation and chl specific absorption but neglecting 
the contribution from inorganic suspended matter and detritus.
Check the ORCA2 mask to see in the history how to generate the mask file from the mesh_mask.
The standard mesh_mask.nc file can also be used directly.
Check the namelist chlsat.nml for explanations of the input parameters

This tool also computes the integrated primary production (gross and net) down to 1% and
0.1% light level by setting the flag compute_intpp and providing the paths to the files
containing BFM diagnostics ruPPYc and resPPYc.
