# C1D_PAPA_BFM: the 1-dimensional BFM-NEMO coupling

This version requires NEMO release 3.6 and above
It contains the following NEMO files in addition to the BFM files
- cpp_C1D_PAPA_BFM.fcm
- namelist_cfg
- iodef.xml
Note that in case the NEMO code is upgraded, the previous files
must be manually changed accordingly

The run directory is created in $BFMDIR_RUN/gyre_bfm just like all other
BFM presets and the nemo executable are linked to there as well as
the NEMO reference configurations
