! DESCRIPTION
!   List of parameters values

!   This file is generated directly from OpenSesame model code, using a code 
!   generator which transposes from the sesame meta language into F90.
!   F90 code generator written by P. Ruardij.
!   structure of the code based on ideas of M. Vichi.
!
! !INTERFACE
