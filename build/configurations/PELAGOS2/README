# PELAGOS2: the global ocean BFM-NEMO coupling @ORCA2

This version requires NEMO release >= 3.6 
This preset is not part of the official NEMO release but uses
the NEMO makenemo tool to create the configuration in the CONFIG 
directory to allow the compilation with FCM.
Be aware that the file containing the CPP macros IS FOUND in this directory
and once you have created the corresponding configuration directory
in the NEMO tree it will be copied there and should be modified from there.

The run directory is created in $BFMDIR_RUN/pelagos2 just like all other
BFM presets and the nemo executable is linked to there.
