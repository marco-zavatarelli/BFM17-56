The GOTM source code needs to be patched to use the BFM model.

Only 4 files are actually changed:
compilers/compiler.IFORT
src/Rules.make
src/extras/bio/Makefile
src/gotm/gotm.F90

To apply the patch execute the following command:

cd $GOTMDIR
patch -p0 < $BFMDIR/src/gotm/patch_gotm

where $GOTMDIR and $BFMDIR are the top-level directories of GOTM and BFM.
