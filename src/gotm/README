The GOTM source code needs to be patched to use the BFM model.
Only 3 files are actually changed (see file patch_gotm in this directory).
To apply the patch execute the following command:

cd $GOTMDIR
patch -p0 < $BFMDIR/src/gotm/patch_gotm

where $GOTMDIR and $BFMDIR are the top-level directories of GOTM and BFM.
