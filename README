# Members of the BFM agreement
#---------------------------------

The development of the BFM is supported by a system team through a formal agreement. 
The agreement establishes a program for model development that is discussed 
and prepared every year by the participants. Model developments are inserted 
by the system team into the different releases of the model. 
The agreement is open to entrance of more contributors and more information can be 
requested to info(at)bfm-community.eu
