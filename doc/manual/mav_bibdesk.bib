	Abstract = {Zooplankton mortality in plankton population models is often represented by the so-called closure term. Recently, much attention has been paid to the choice of functional form used for the closure term, primarily due to the influential paper by Steele and Henderson (J. Plankton Res., 14, 157--172, 1992). Here we reveal an inconsistency in the normalization of Steele and Henderson's models, and show that unforced short-term oscillations (limit cycles) can occur when a quadratic closure term is used. Furthermore, we contradict the hypothesis regarding the relationship between nutrient steady-state values and the choice of closure term: using the seven-component plankton model of Fasham (The Global Carbon Cycle, Heimann,M. (ed.), pp. 457--504, 1993) with four alternative closure terms, we find the nutrient value to depend more upon the choice of parameter values than on the choice of closure term. However, our results agree with and strengthen the general conclusion of Steele and Henderson's work: that the choice of closure term can strongly influence the dynamics of models.},

@article{Condon31122012,
	Abstract = {A perceived recent increase in global jellyfish abundance has been portrayed as a symptom of degraded oceans. This perception is based primarily on a few case studies and anecdotal evidence, but a formal analysis of global temporal trends in jellyfish populations has been missing. Here, we analyze all available long-term datasets on changes in jellyfish abundance across multiple coastal stations, using linear and logistic mixed models and effect-size analysis to show that there is no robust evidence for a global increase in jellyfish. Although there has been a small linear increase in jellyfish since the 1970s, this trend was unsubstantiated by effect-size analysis that showed no difference in the proportion of increasing vs. decreasing jellyfish populations over all time periods examined. Rather, the strongest nonrandom trend indicated jellyfish populations undergo larger, worldwide oscillations with an approximate 20-y periodicity, including a rising phase during the 1990s that contributed to the perception of a global increase in jellyfish abundance. Sustained monitoring is required over the next decade to elucidate with statistical confidence whether the weak increasing linear trend in jellyfish after 1970 is an actual shift in the baseline or part of an oscillation. Irrespective of the nature of increase, given the potential damage posed by jellyfish blooms to fisheries, tourism, and other human industries, our findings foretell recurrent phases of rise and fall in jellyfish populations that society should be prepared to face.},

@article{gentleman08,
	Abstract = {Modellers have long been aware that the mathematical form of zooplankton mortality, or closure, significantly affects the dynamics of planktonic ecosystem models. Another important formulation is the functional response, i.e. how ingestion rates change with prey density. Here we explain why different grazing responses can have profoundly differing influences on modelled dynamics, and how common practices may limit models due to misguided characterization of feeding behaviours. Use of different ingestion functions in a Nutrient--Phytoplankton--Zooplankton (NPZ) model results in oscillating versus constant densities. Contrary to the conclusions of previous studies, it is shown that these results are not due to zooplankton satiation versus non-satiation. Analysis of a predator-prey model is used to derive the necessary condition for ecological stability, which is related to food-limited clearance rates. Sensitivity studies demonstrate that zooplankton clearance rates have a strong influence on the dynamics of more complex models. Moreover, it is shown that acclimation time lags can dramatically alter results from those where zooplankton instantly adapt to changing prey densities due to the corollary effect on clearance rates. These results are discussed in terms of practical advice to modellers who face uncertainty in choosing expressions for the functional response.},

	Abstract = {A mechanistic explanation for the accumulation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), observed in coastal seas such as the Northern Adriatic Sea, is proposed here on the basis of numerical simulations of the marine ecosystem dynamics carried out with a coupled biogeochemical-circulation model. The biogeochemical model is based on the European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model (ERSEM) upgraded with a more detailed representation of the DOC-bacteria interactions and resolving different level of DOC lability/refractivity. The circulation model is the Adriatic Sea implementation of the Princeton Ocean Model. The analysis of simulations confirms the important role of the Po river nutrient input on the ecosystem dynamics and highlights the presence of a strong across-shelf trophic gradient that, affecting the Bacterial Growth Efficiency (BGE), could be a key factor for the DOC accumulation. The simulations show the importance of circulation features in modulating the exchanges between areas having different trophic structure such as the western coastal strip, strongly influenced by the Po river runoff, and the open sea areas in the centre of the northern Adriatic sub-basin. The DOC produced in the high energy system of the Po runoff coastal strip, characterized by high BGE, is transported toward the open areas, which is a more oligotrophic environment with lower BGE. In this area the DOC turnover time is strongly increased giving rise to the DOC accumulation.},

@article{polimene06b,
	Abstract = {A three-dimensional coupled biogeochemical-circulation numerical model was implemented in the Adriatic Sea. The biogeochemical part of the model is a development of the European Seas Regional Ecosystem Model (ERSEM II), while the circulation model is the Adriatic Sea implementation of the Princeton Ocean Model (POM). The model was run under climatological monthly varying atmospheric and river runoff forcing in order to reproduce seasonal circulation and biochemical processes. Simulated chlorophyll, nutrient, and plankton biomass and distributions were analyzed and compared with the data coming from a historic in situ data set and a newly constructed chlorophyll climatological data set from SeaWiFS. Model reproduction of the chlorophyll seasonal cycle is, at least qualitatively, in good agreement both with the remote sensing and the in situ data. However, larger production than observed is simulated during the late winter and spring, probably due to inadequate knowledge of the nutrient inputs. Comparison between simulated nutrients and observations shows a general underestimation for orthophosphate and orthosilicate, while nitrate is mostly overestimated. The shape of the nutrient-simulated profiles is in qualitatively good agreement with observations in the central and southern part of the basin. The analysis of the ratio between the large ({$>$}20 \&{\#}956;m) and small ({$<$}20 \&{\#}956;m) phytoplankton biomass and between the bacteria and phytoplankton biomass shows that the Western Adriatic Coastal Current is not only a physical frontal structure but also an ecosystem front, where larger phytoplankton grow on the coastal side while smaller ones are present offshore where the microbial loop is the dominant food web.},

	Abstract = {Objectively analyzed fields of satellite sea surface temperature (SST, advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) Pathfinder) and sea surface height anomaly (SSHA, combined TOPEX/Poseidon\&{\#}8211;ERS-1/2) are used to characterize, statistically, the mesoscale variability about the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series Study (BATS) site. These results are applied to the in situ BATS time series data and a local one-dimensional (1-D) physical upper ocean model to better understand the contribution of mesoscale eddies to the time series record and the model-data mismatch. Using a low-pass spatial filter, we decompose the anomalies from the seasonal cycle into two components: the large-scale, regional climate variability and a mesoscale signal. The mesoscale SST and SSHA fields are positively cross-correlated at a statistically significant level, consistent with near-surface isotherm displacements for cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. The results from time-lagged cross-correlation analysis show that detectable eddy signatures exist in the in situ SST data and that eddies are a noticeable (\&{\#}8764;10{\%}) but not dominant error source for the 1-D model solution. Several factors may be at work: the 1-D model captures a more regional signal, whereas the BATS in situ data include small-scale spatial heterogeneity; the satellite data and 1-D model are indirectly coupled via the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis forcing data; and the satellite-based mesoscale variability estimates are also missing specific events because of the sparse space-time sampling of a polar orbiting, visible/infrared wavelength sensor. The mesoscale eddy cross-correlation signature did not show up clearly in a similar analysis conducted on the original anomaly fields, highlighting the fact that climate scale variability needs to be carefully removed to isolate the eddy signature.},

@article{vichi-GBC-11,
	Abstract = {The concept of ocean biogeochemical provinces is based on the observation that large ocean regions are characterized by coherent physical forcing and environmental conditions, which are eventually representative of macroscale ocean ecosystems. Biogeochemical models of the global ocean focus on simulating the coupling between prevalent physical conditions and the biogeochemical processes with the assumption that biological properties respond coherently to physics and therefore should produce such provinces as an emergent property. In this paper, we quantitatively assess the emergence of a reference set of predefined biogeochemical provinces in the available global data sets and propose a province-based approach to the evaluation of one of the most comprehensive models of ocean biogeochemistry. Multivariate statistical tools were applied to model and observation data, verifying the existence, distinctiveness and reliability of the predefined provinces and quantifying the correlation of model results with observations at the global scale. The analysis of similarity between provinces shows that they are statistically separable in data and model output and therefore can be used as reliable metrics. The analyses indicate that provinces can be more easily distinguished in terms of their environmental features rather than using chlorophyll concentration. The characterization of provinces by means of chlorophyll values shows a significant overlap in both the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) data and the model. It is likely this is related to the choice of province boundaries based on coarse-resolution mapped data, which are not necessarily the same as those derivable from high-resolution satellite data. We also demonstrated through cluster analysis that the long-term time series data collected at Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) stations are representative of environmental conditions of the respective province and can thus be used to evaluate model results extracted from that province. The method shows promise for helping to overcome problems with model verification due to under sampling of most ocean biogeochemical variables but also gives indications that unsupervised clustering may be required when more spatially resolved data and models are available.},

@article{conversi09,
	Abstract = {Understanding the impact of climate change on zooplankton populations is of major importance, as they represent the basis for higher trophic levels in the marine food web. In this study we analyze the 36-year copepod abundance time series in the Gulf of Trieste, northern Adriatic, to investigate its interannual variability, with particular attention to species trends and phenology. Following the analysis of the local winter sea surface temperature, two periods are identified: 1970\&{\#}8211;1987 and 1988\&{\#}8211;2005. These periods are characterized by ecosystem-wide changes: an approximate doubling in total copepod abundance, the arrival of a new species (Diaixis pygmoea), the rise (Paracalanus parvus, Oncaea spp., Oithona spp., and Euterpina acutifrons) or decline (Pseudocalanus elongatus, Clausocalanus spp.) of several taxa, and changes in the phenology in several species, with predominantly forward shifts in the timing of the maximum peak. While Acartia clausi remains the dominant species, there is a general trend toward smaller species in the second period. Our results also indicate the large, possibly critical, reduction in the abundance of the species Pseudocalanus elongatus. We hypothesize that the changes in copepod abundances and community composition in the Gulf of Trieste are related to the general warming in the sea surface temperature and associated northerly displacement of the ecosystem and to the changes in the Mediterranean circulation that began at the end of the 1980s and affected the whole basin in the following years as part of the phenomenon called the Eastern Mediterranean Transient.},

	Abstract = {Increasing availability and extent of biological ocean time series (from both in situ and satellite data) have helped reveal significant phenological variability of marine plankton. The extent to which the range of this variability is modified as a result of climate change is of obvious importance. Here we summarize recent research results on phenology of both phytoplankton and zooplankton. We suggest directions to better quantify and monitor future plankton phenology shifts, including (i) examining the main mode of expected future changes (ecological shifts in timing and spatial distribution to accommodate fixed environmental niches vs. evolutionary adaptation of timing controls to maintain fixed biogeography and seasonality), (ii) broader understanding of phenology at the species and community level (e.g. for zooplankton beyond Calanus and for phytoplankton beyond chlorophyll), (iii) improving and diversifying statistical metrics for indexing timing and trophic synchrony and (iv) improved consideration of spatio-temporal scales and the Lagrangian nature of plankton assemblages to separate time from space changes.},

	Abstract = {Today's surface ocean is saturated with respect to calcium carbonate, but increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are reducing ocean pH and carbonate ion concentrations, and thus the level of calcium carbonate saturation. Experimental evidence suggests that if these trends continue, key marine organisms--such as corals and some plankton--will have difficulty maintaining their external calcium carbonate skeletons. Here we use 13 models of the ocean-carbon cycle to assess calcium carbonate saturation under the IS92a 'business-as-usual' scenario for future emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. In our projections, Southern Ocean surface waters will begin to become undersaturated with respect to aragonite, a metastable form of calcium carbonate, by the year 2050. By 2100, this undersaturation could extend throughout the entire Southern Ocean and into the subarctic Pacific Ocean. When live pteropods were exposed to our predicted level of undersaturation during a two-day shipboard experiment, their aragonite shells showed notable dissolution. Our findings indicate that conditions detrimental to high-latitude ecosystems could develop within decades, not centuries as suggested previously.},

	Abstract = {Hydrographic observations indicated a shift of the main deep water formation in the Mediterranean Sea from its usual location in the Adriatic Sea to the Aegean Sea during the late 1980s and early 1990s, during winters 1991/1992 and 1992/1993. This event is known as the Eastern Mediterranean Transient (EMT). We report here a connection between EMT and specific atmospheric conditions which created anomalously large buoyancy fluxes from the Aegean Sea during winters 1991/1992 and 1992/1993 (the \&{\#}8220;enhanced EMT winters\&{\#}8221;). We use newly available, state of the art datasets with high space and time resolution and show that atypical cyclonic activity in the central Mediterranean versus the eastern basin produced the enhanced atmospheric forcing which intensified the EMT. An abatement of the frequency of cyclones in the central Mediterranean during 1992/1993 drastically reduced the northward advection of warm air over the Aegean Sea compared to more typical years, while an increase in the frequency of cyclones in the eastern Mediterranean enhanced the southward advection of cold air over the Aegean Sea, especially during 1991/1992. These changes significantly increased buoyancy flux losses from the Aegean Sea during the enhanced EMT winters, intensifying deep water production.},

This is the "Earth system": a highly complex entity characterized by multiple nonlinear responses and thresholds, with linkages between disparate components. One important part of this system is the iron cycle, in which iron-containing soil dust is transported from land through the atmosphere to the oceans, affecting ocean biogeochemistry and hence having feedback effects on climate and dust production. Here we review the key components of this cycle, identifying critical uncertainties and priorities for future research.},

	Abstract = {Recent analyses of global warming projections simulated with global climate models (GCMs) suggest that the tropical Pacific does not become El Ni{\`O}o- or La Ni{\`O}a-like in response to increased greenhouse gases (GHGs). Rather, the physical mechanisms that drive tropical Pacific climate change depart substantially from the El Ni{\`O}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) analogy often invoked for interpreting future climate changes {$[$}e.g., Knutson and Manabe, 1995; Meehl and Washington, 1996; Cane et al., 1997; Collins et al., 2005; Meehl et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2008; Cox et al., 2004{$]$} and past climate changes {$[$}e.g. Lea et al., 2001; Koutavas et al., 2002{$]$}. This presents an opportunity for reconciling theory, models, and observations.An ENSO analogy typically is invoked for interpreting tropical Pacific climate change because if an external forcing introduces some east-west asymmetry, this asymmetry can be amplified in the same way as interannual perturbations are, through the positive ocean-atmosphere Bjerknes feedback. This then would lead to an altered mean state of the tropical Pacific resembling El Ni{\`O}o or La Ni{\`O}a {$[$}Dijkstra and Neelin, 1995{$]$}. For instance, the model projections used for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) anticipate tropical Pacific climate change in response to increased GHGs that has been described as El Ni{\`O}o\&{\#}8212;like {$[$}Meehl et al., 2007{$]$}. These models project robust enhanced equatorial warming {$[$}Liu et al., 2006; DiNezio et al., 2009{$]$} and a weakening of the overturning atmosphere circulation across the tropical Pacific, i.e., the Walker circulation {$[$}Vecchi and Soden, 2007{$]$}, both of which occur during El Ni{\`O}o events. However, these experiments also show a shoaling and sharpening of the equatorial thermocline {$[$}Vecchi and Soden, 2007; DiNezio et al., 2009{$]$} (Figure 1a). This is in contrast to El Ni{\`O}o events, when the thermocline response is heavily dominated by a relaxed tilt (Figure 1b).},

@article{saba10,
	Abstract = {The performance of 36 models (22 ocean color models and 14 biogeochemical ocean circulation models (BOGCMs)) that estimate depth-integrated marine net primary productivity (NPP) was assessed by comparing their output to in situ 14C data at the Bermuda Atlantic Time series Study (BATS) and the Hawaii Ocean Time series (HOT) over nearly two decades. Specifically, skill was assessed based on the models' ability to estimate the observed mean, variability, and trends of NPP. At both sites, more than 90{\%} of the models underestimated mean NPP, with the average bias of the BOGCMs being nearly twice that of the ocean color models. However, the difference in overall skill between the best BOGCM and the best ocean color model at each site was not significant. Between 1989 and 2007, in situ NPP at BATS and HOT increased by an average of nearly 2{\%} per year and was positively correlated to the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation index. The majority of ocean color models produced in situ NPP trends that were closer to the observed trends when chlorophyll-a was derived from high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), rather than fluorometric or SeaWiFS data. However, this was a function of time such that average trend magnitude was more accurately estimated over longer time periods. Among BOGCMs, only two individual models successfully produced an increasing NPP trend (one model at each site). We caution against the use of models to assess multiannual changes in NPP over short time periods. Ocean color model estimates of NPP trends could improve if more high quality HPLC chlorophyll-a time series were available.},

	Abstract = {Climate engineering has been proposed as a possible response to anthropogenic climate change. While climate engineering may be able to stabilize temperatures, it is generally assumed that this will not prevent continued ocean acidification. However, due to the strong coupling between climate and the carbon cycle, climate engineering could indirectly affect ocean chemistry. We used a global Earth-system model to investigate how climate engineering may affect surface ocean pH and the degree of aragonite saturation. Climate engineering could significantly re-distribute carbon emissions among atmosphere, land and ocean reservoirs. This could slow pH decreases somewhat relative to the non-engineered case, but would not affect the level of aragonite saturation due to opposing responses of pH and aragonite saturation to temperature change. However, these effects are dependent on enhanced carbon accumulation in the land biosphere; without this, climate engineering has little effect on pH, and leads to accelerated declines in aragonite saturation.},

	Abstract = {Carbon capture from ambient air has been proposed as a mitigation strategy to counteract anthropogenic climate change. We use an Earth system model to investigate the response of the coupled climate--carbon system to an instantaneous removal of all anthropogenic CO 2 from the atmosphere. In our extreme and idealized simulations, anthropogenic CO 2 emissions are halted and all anthropogenic CO 2 is removed from the atmosphere at year 2050 under the IPCC A2 CO 2 emission scenario when the model-simulated atmospheric CO 2 reaches 511 ppm and surface temperature reaches 1.8 $\,^{\circ}$C above the pre-industrial level. In our simulations a one-time removal of all anthropogenic CO 2 in the atmosphere reduces surface air temperature by 0.8 $\,^{\circ}$C within a few years, but 1 $\,^{\circ}$C surface warming above pre-industrial levels lasts for several centuries. In other words, a one-time removal of 100% excess CO 2 from the atmosphere offsets less than 50% of the warming experienced at the time of removal. To maintain atmospheric CO 2 and temperature at low levels, not only does anthropogenic CO 2 in the atmosphere need to be removed, but anthropogenic CO 2 stored in the ocean and land needs to be removed as well when it outgasses to the atmosphere. In our simulation to maintain atmospheric CO 2 concentrations at pre-industrial levels for centuries, an additional amount of CO 2 equal to the original CO 2 captured would need to be removed over the subsequent 80 years.},

	Abstract = {In this study a coupled ocean-atmosphere model containing interactive marine biogeochemistry is used to analyze interannual, lagged, and decadal marine biogeochemical responses to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the dominant mode of North Atlantic atmospheric variability. The coupled model adequately reproduces present-day climatologies and NAO atmospheric variability. It is shown that marine biogeochemical responses to the NAO are governed by different mechanisms according to the time scale considered. On interannual time scales, local changes in vertical mixing, caused by modifications in air-sea heat, freshwater, and momentum fluxes, are most relevant in influencing phytoplankton growth through light and nutrient limitation mechanisms. At subpolar latitudes, deeper mixing occurring during positive NAO winters causes a slight decrease in late winter chlorophyll concentration due to light limitation and a 10{\%}\&{\#}8211;20{\%} increase in spring chlorophyll concentration due to higher nutrient availability. The lagged response of physical and biogeochemical properties to a high NAO winter shows some memory in the following 2 years. In particular, subsurface nutrient anomalies generated by local changes in mixing near the American coast are advected along the North Atlantic Current, where they are suggested to affect downstream chlorophyll concentration with 1 year lag. On decadal time scales, local and remote mechanisms act contemporaneously in shaping the decadal biogeochemical response to the NAO. The slow circulation adjustment, in response to NAO wind stress curl anomalies, causes a basin redistribution of heat, freshwater, and biogeochemical properties which, in turn, modifies the spatial structure of the subpolar chlorophyll bloom.},

	Abstract = {The physical effects of hurricanes include deepening of the mixed layer and decreasing of the sea surface temperature in response to entrainment, curl-induced upwelling, and increased upper ocean cooling. However, the biological effects of hurricanes remain relatively unexplored. In this paper, we examine the passages of 13 hurricanes through the Sargasso Sea region of the North Atlantic during the years 1998 through 2001. Remotely sensed ocean color shows increased concentrations of surface chlorophyll within the cool wakes of the hurricanes, apparently in response to the injection of nutrients and/or biogenic pigments into the oligotrophic surface waters. This increase in post-storm surface chlorophyll concentration usually lasted 2\&{\#}8211;3 weeks before it returned to its nominal pre-hurricane level.},

@article{bidigare09,
	Abstract = {Biological responses to basin-scale climate forcing in the subtropical North Pacific Ocean are assessed based on temporal variations in plankton community structure observed at Station ALOHA and results of a coupled physical--biogeochemical model. Observational data and model simulations for the period 1990--2004 reveal distinct temporal patterns, with significant increases in net primary productivity, modeled nitrate flux into the euphotic zone and the measured downward flux of particulate nitrogen during 1999--2004. Concurrent increases in microalgae, cyanobacteria and modeled and measured zooplankton biomass were also observed during this period. We provide evidence that these responses were a consequence of climate forcing that destratified the upper ocean, making it more susceptible to mixing events and nutrient entrainment. These findings underscore the importance of nitrate flux and plankton community structure, as modulated by climate forcing, in regulating particle export over interannual and decadal time scales.},

@article{tsimplis97,
	Abstract = {Current meter data from six moorings are analyzed to study current variability at the straits of the Cretan Arc which connect the south Aegean Sea with the eastern Mediterranean. The three layers in which the current meters were deployed show different current characteristics. The upper layer shows evidence of the Asia Minor current in the Rhodes Strait and a clockwise eddy in the Karpathos Strait. Water in the middle layer moves slowly into the south Aegean. The bottom current meters in Kassos and Antikithira Straits recorded currents, steady in amplitude and direction, with speeds equal to or higher than those observed in the upper layer. The observations suggest a significant outflow (0.5 Sv) of Cretan Dense Water (CDW) to the Levantine and Ionian Seas. Rotary empirical orthogonal functions are used to extract and describe the coherent part of the variability. Forty-four percent of the total variability is described by the first three empirical orthogonal functions. Less than 20{\%} of the current variability of the western strait is coherent with variability of the eastern straits. The coherent part of the variability refers mainly to periods longer than 20 days. The current meter data are compared with atmospheric pressure, showing good correlation during the first period of the measurements, when a major atmospheric pressure low passed over the Aegean.},

	Abstract = {This work is dedicated to the study of the climate variability of the Mediterranean Sea, in particular the study of the Eastern Mediterranean Transient (EMT) which occurred in the early 1990s. Simulations of the 1961\&{\#}8211;2000 period have been carried out with an eddy-permitting Ocean General Circulation Model of the Mediterranean Sea, driven by realistic interannual high-resolution air-sea fluxes. Using different databases for the river runoff, Black Sea inflow, and Atlantic thermohaline characteristics at climatological or interannual scales, we assess the effects of the non-atmospheric hydrological forcings on the simulation of the interannual variations of the Mediterranean circulation. The evolution of the basin-scale heat content is in very good agreement with the observations (especially in the surface and intermediate layers), while the agreement is lower for the evolution of the salt content. Convection events in the Aegean Sea are noticed in the simulations between 1972 and 1976, in the late 1980s, and around the EMT period. The formation rates of Cretan Deep Water (CDW) are different during these periods, allowing or preventing the spreading of CDW into the eastern Mediterranean. The sequence of the EMT events is well reproduced: the high winter oceanic surface cooling and net evaporation over the Aegean Sea in the early 1990s, the high amount of dense CDW formed during these winters, and then the overflow and the spreading of this CDW in the eastern Mediterranean. Among the preconditioning processes suggested in the literature, we find that changes in the Levantine surface circulation, possibly induced by the presence in the Cretan Passage of anticyclonic eddies and a lasting period with reduced net precipitation over the eastern Mediterranean, lead to an increase of the salt content of the Aegean Sea. Changes in the Black Sea freshwater inflow or in the characteristic of the Atlantic Water entering at the Gibraltar Strait also modify the thermohaline state of the Aegean Sea before the EMT. But, as none of these preconditioning factors has a lasting impact on lowering the vertical stratification of the Aegean Sea, we conclude that concerning the EMT, the major triggering elements are the atmospheric fluxes and winds occurring in winters 1991\&{\#}8211;1992 and 1992\&{\#}8211;1993.},

	Abstract = {Trends and variability in the ocean-atmosphere CO2 flux and the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 are simulated for the period 1948\&{\#}8211;2003, using a biogeochemical carbon cycle model (HAMOCC5) coupled online to a global ocean general circulation model (MPI-OM). The model is forced by daily National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis data from 1948 to 2003. We find a global interannual variability of $\pm$0.50 PgC yr\&{\#}8722;1 (2\&{\#}963;) which is largely dominated by ocean dynamics in the equatorial Pacific. On decadal scale, two patterns are of global importance. First, the regime shift that occurs in 1975\&{\#}8211;1977 when the modeled interannual variability of the equatorial Pacific changes from $\pm$0.32 PgC yr\&{\#}8722;1 to $\pm$0.23 PgC yr\&{\#}8722;1 and the mean outgasing of CO2 decreases from 0.70 PgC yr\&{\#}8722;1 to 0.58 PgC yr\&{\#}8722;1. Second, the trend that occurs in the Southern Ocean, where we find an increase of the CO2 fluxes over the full 56-year simulation period. The flux results from stronger upwelling and deeper mixed layers which are caused by increasing wind velocities. We estimate an average CO2 flux into the ocean of 1.49 PgC yr\&{\#}8722;1 for 1980\&{\#}8211;1989 and 1.74 PgC yr\&{\#}8722;1 for 1990\&{\#}8211;1999, with extremes of 1.20 PgC yr\&{\#}8722;1 at the La Ni{\`O}a event in 1996 and 2.10 PgC yr\&{\#}8722;1 during the El Ni{\`O}o events in 1993 and 1998. Because of the rising buffer factor, the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 is slowing down in regions of shallow mixing toward the end of the simulation. Overall, about 124 Pg of anthropogenic carbon has accumulated in the model ocean until the end of 2003.},

	Abstract = {Atmospheric deposition is an important source of nutrients to the coastal and open ocean; however, its role in highly productive upwelling regions like coastal California has not been determined. Approximately 0.1{\%}\&{\#}8211;0.2{\%} of new production is attributable to atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (N) annually, but if the estimate is expanded to encompass the effects of iron (Fe), aerosols may support 1{\%}\&{\#}8211;2{\%} of new production on average, and up to 5{\%} on days with high deposition fluxes. Laboratory culture and in situ incubation experiments confirm the bioavailability of N from dry deposition in this region. A significant positive relationship between aerosol optical thickness and chlorophyll a derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer is observed for the summer months and is stronger offshore than near the coast. Moreover, the portion of productivity supported by atmospheric deposition is higher on days without upwelling and during El Ni{\`O}o periods when nutrient input from upwelling is suppressed, a phenomenon that could become more prevalent due to climate warming. Expanding the results from California, we estimate that dry deposition could increase productivity in other major coastal upwelling regions by up to 8{\%} and suggest that aerosols could stimulate productivity by providing N, Fe, and other nutrients that are essential for cell growth but relatively deplete in upwelled water.},

@article{taucher11,
	Abstract = {A global Earth System model is employed to investigate the role of direct temperature effects in the response of marine ecosystems to climate change. While model configurations with and without consideration of explicit temperature effects can reproduce observed current biogeochemical tracer distributions and estimated carbon export about equally well, carbon flow through the model ecosystem reveals strong temperature sensitivities. Depending on whether biological processes are assumed temperature sensitive or not, simulated marine net primary production (NPP) increases or decreases under projected climate change driven by a business-as-usual CO2 emission scenario for the 21st century. This suggests that indirect temperature effects such as changes in the supply of nutrients and light are not the only relevant factors to be considered when modeling the response of marine ecosystems to climate change. A better understanding of direct temperature effects on marine ecosystems is required before even the direction of change in NPP can be reliably predicted.},

	Abstract = {Most climate models predict a weakening of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation for the 21st century when forced by increasing levels of greenhouse gas concentrations. The model spread, however, is rather large, even when the forcing scenario is identical, indicating a large uncertainty in the response to forcing. In order to reduce the model uncertainties a weighting procedure is applied considering the skill of each model in simulating hydrographic properties and observation-based circulation estimates. This procedure yields a \&{\#}8220;best estimate\&{\#}8221; for the evolution of the North Atlantic THC during the 21st century by taking into account a measure of model quality. Using 28 projections from 9 different coupled global climate models of a scenario of future CO2 increase (SRESA1B) performed for the upcoming fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the analysis predicts a gradual weakening of the North Atlantic THC by 25($\pm$25){\%} until 2100.},

	Abstract = {Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations over the past two centuries have led to greater CO2 uptake by the oceans. This acidification process has changed the saturation state of the oceans with respect to calcium carbonate (CaCO3) particles. Here we estimate the in situ CaCO3 dissolution rates for the global oceans from total alkalinity and chlorofluorocarbon data, and we also discuss the future impacts of anthropogenic CO2 on CaCO3 shell-forming species. CaCO3 dissolution rates, ranging from 0.003 to 1.2 micromoles per kilogram per year, are observed beginning near the aragonite saturation horizon. The total water column CaCO3 dissolution rate for the global oceans is approximately 0.5 +/- 0.2 petagrams of CaCO3-C per year, which is approximately 45 to 65\% of the export production of CaCO3.},

The naivete of some of these misunderstandings suggests that they are too seldom examined. In this paper, I address what I consider to be the most ill-conceived criticisms of ecological theory. I propose that the parallels between theoretical and empirical research are more profound than most people realize. Appreciation of these parallels will go a long way towards bridging the gap between empiricists and theoreticians in ecology},

	Annote = { Modelling methodology, it is argued, is primarily about providing explanations of data which, if sufficiently convincing, provide a basis for prediction and forecasting. Models allow us to synthesise our knowledge and explore its ramifications, leading to insight and discovery. As such, modelling is invaluable to the progress of marine science, the development and implementation of ever more complex models moving in tandem with our expanding knowledge base. It is possible to argue, however, that mathematics can be "unreasonably effective" at describing phenomena, particularly for complex models where there are often many free parameters to tune against limited data. Errors become difficult to pinpoint and correct, and creativity may be stifled as models become entrenched within the prevailing paradigm. Indiscriminately adding layer upon layer of complexity in models may therefore be counter productive, particularly if prediction of future scenarios such as changing climate is the ultimate goal. The inclusion of additional complexity in models is nevertheless desirable, where relevant and practicable. New modelling approaches that are coming to the fore likely hold the key to future progress such as targeting complexity in key species and trophic levels, adaptive parameterisations and the representation of physiological trade-offs, providing the potential to simulate emergent community structure.},

	Annote = { The paper by Hannah et al. (this volume) invokes foodweb theory and the ideas of complexity theory to guide the construction of models of intermediate complexity, which sacrifice explicit process detail to increase the number of interacting components of the system and simulate the web of feedback loops. This approach has its merits, if best practice modelling guidelines are followed and the method is used well. However, if this is not the case then the fundamental weakness of the intermediate model approach is that it may end up producing models that are over general and therefore not useful. To make the most of the intermediate complexity approach it is essential to keep the tenets of the middle-out approach in mind. Under the middle-out approach computational models are constructed and tested at the levels where we have the most detailed information, building on our existing knowledge and data and coupling a hierarchy of models rather than being swamped in a morass of detail or missing key feedbacks through over-generality.},

	Abstract = {About one quarter of the CO2 emitted to the atmosphere by human activities is absorbed annually by the ocean. All the processes that influence the oceanic uptake of CO2 are controlled by climate. Hence changes in climate (both natural and human-induced) are expected to alter the uptake of CO2 by the ocean. However, available information that constrains the direction, magnitude, or rapidity of the response of ocean CO2 to changes in climate is limited. We present an analysis of oceanic CO2 trends for 1981 to 2007 from data and a model. Our analysis suggests that the global ocean responded to recent changes in climate by outgassing some preindustrial carbon, in part compensating the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2. Using a model, we estimate that climate change and variability reduced the CO2 uptake by 12{\%} compared to a simulation where constant climate is imposed, and offset 63{\%} of the trend in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 alone. The response is caused by changes in wind patterns and ocean warming, with important nonlinear effects that amplify the response of oceanic CO2 to changes in climate by {$>$} 30{\%}.},

	Abstract = {A model of the ocean and seafloor carbon cycle is subjected to injection of new CO2 pulses of varying sizes to estimate the resident atmospheric fraction over the coming 100 kyr. The model is used to separate the processes of air-sea equilibrium, an ocean temperature feedback, CaCO3 compensation, and silicate weathering on the residual anthropogenic pCO2 in the atmosphere at 1, 10, and 100 kyr. The mean lifetime of anthropogenic CO2 is dominated by the long tail, resulting in a range of 30\&{\#}8211;35 kyr. The long lifetime of fossil fuel carbon release implies that the anthropogenic climate perturbation may have time to interact with ice sheets, methane clathrate deposits, and glacial/interglacial climate dynamics.},

	Abstract = {The long term abiological sinks for anthropogenic CO2 will be dissolution in the oceans and chemical neutralization by reaction with carbonates and basic igneous rocks. We use a detailed ocean/sediment carbon cycle model to simulate the response of the carbonate cycle in the ocean to a range of anthropogenic CO2 release scenarios. CaCO3 will play only a secondary role in buffering the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere because CaCO3 reaction uptake capacity and kinetics are limited by the dynamics of the ocean carbon cycle. Dissolution into ocean water sequesters 70\&{\#}8211;80{\%} of the CO2 release on a time scale of several hundred years. Chemical neutralization of CO2 by reaction with CaCO3 on the sea floor accounts for another 9\&{\#}8211;15{\%} decrease in the atmospheric concentration on a time scale of 5.5\&{\#}8211;6.8 kyr. Reaction with CaCO3 on land accounts for another 3\&{\#}8211;8{\%}, with a time scale of 8.2 kyr. The final equilibrium with CaCO3 leaves 7.5\&{\#}8211;8{\%} of the CO2 release remaining in the atmosphere. The carbonate chemistry of the oceans in contact with CaCO3 will act to buffer atmospheric CO2 at this higher concentration until the entire fossil fuel CO2 release is consumed by weathering of basic igneous rocks on a time scale of 200 kyr.},

	Abstract = {Phytoplankton plays an important role in the global carbon cycle via the fixation of inorganic carbon during photosynthesis. However, the efficiency of this \&{\#}8220;biological pump of carbon\&{\#}8221; strongly depends on the nature of the phytoplankton. Monitoring spatial and temporal variations of the distribution of dominant phytoplankton groups at the global scale is thus of critical importance. Recently, an algorithm has been developed to detect the major dominant phytoplankton groups from anomalies of the marine signal measured by ocean color satellites. This method, called PHYSAT, allows to identify nanoeucaryotes, Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and diatoms. In this paper, PHYSAT has been improved to detect an additional group, named phaeocystis-like, by analyzing specific signal anomalies in the Southern Ocean during winter months. This new version of PHYSAT was then used to process daily global SeaWiFS GAC data between 1998 and 2006. The global distribution of major phytoplankton groups is presented in this study as a monthly climatology of the most frequent phytoplankton group. The contribution of nanoeucaryotes-dominated waters to the global ocean varies from 45 to 70{\%} depending on the season, whereas both diatoms and phaeocystis-like contributions exhibit a stronger seasonal variability mostly due to the large blooms that occur during winter in the Southern Ocean. Three regions of particular interest are also studied in more details: the Southern Ocean, the North Atlantic, and the Equatorial Pacific. The North Atlantic diatom bloom shows a large interannual variability. Large blooms of both diatoms and phaeocystis-like are observed during winter in the Southern Ocean, with a larger contribution from diatoms. Their respective geographical distribution is shown to be tightly related to the depth of the mixed-layer, with diatoms prevailing in stratified waters. Synechococcus and Prochloroccocus prevail in the Equatorial Pacific, but our data show also sporadic diatoms contributions in this region during La Ni{\`O}a. The observed seasonal cycle and interannual variability of phytoplankton groups in the global ocean suggest that the PHYSAT archive is suitable to study the impact of climate variability on the structure of marine ecosystems.},

@article{smith10,
	Abstract = {I show that assumptions about how uptake rates depend on concentration strongly impact the interpretation of field observations, specifically with respect to the combined effects of temperature, T, and nitrate concentration, {$[$}NO3{$]$}, on nitrate uptake. The standard assumption that maximum uptake rate, Vmax, is independent of ambient nutrient concentration, Sa, contrasts with the prediction of the recently developed Optimal Uptake kinetics that Vmax should increase hyperbolically with Sa. Assuming Arrhenius T dependence, I fit the respective equations to field observations of chlorophyll-specific Vmax, T and {$[$}NO3{$]$}. The inferred sensitivity to T differs by a factor of two. Considerable uncertainty therefore remains about the T dependence of uptake rates, and therefore about biological production and biogeochemical cycles. Given that both climate change and anthropogenic nutrient inputs are altering the relationship between T and nutrients in the ocean, these uncertainties limit our understanding of the direct effects and associated feedbacks.},

	Abstract = {Detecting the effect of climate change on ocean ecosystems is facilitated if the data are partitioned into ecological provinces. It is recognised that the boundaries of such provinces are dynamic, raising the imperative for frequent observations. Using satellite data, we have assembled a time series of ecosystem delineation for the Northwest Atlantic Ocean over a period of ten years. For each province identified in the study area, we have compiled data on sea-surface temperature, and on the biomass and community composition of phytoplankton. We find significant trends in these properties but they vary according to the province concerned, which emphasizes how the physical and biological changes are correlated at large scale. Comparisons between the trends computed using the average position of the provinces and the trends derived when accounting for the movements of the boundaries underline the value of the new approach.},

@article{rayner03,
	Abstract = {We present the Met Office Hadley Centre's sea ice and sea surface temperature (SST) data set, HadISST1, and the nighttime marine air temperature (NMAT) data set, HadMAT1. HadISST1 replaces the global sea ice and sea surface temperature (GISST) data sets and is a unique combination of monthly globally complete fields of SST and sea ice concentration on a 1$\,^{\circ}$latitude-longitude grid from 1871. The companion HadMAT1 runs monthly from 1856 on a 5$\,^{\circ}$latitude-longitude grid and incorporates new corrections for the effect on NMAT of increasing deck (and hence measurement) heights. HadISST1 and HadMAT1 temperatures are reconstructed using a two-stage reduced-space optimal interpolation procedure, followed by superposition of quality-improved gridded observations onto the reconstructions to restore local detail. The sea ice fields are made more homogeneous by compensating satellite microwave-based sea ice concentrations for the impact of surface melt effects on retrievals in the Arctic and for algorithm deficiencies in the Antarctic and by making the historical in situ concentrations consistent with the satellite data. SSTs near sea ice are estimated using statistical relationships between SST and sea ice concentration. HadISST1 compares well with other published analyses, capturing trends in global, hemispheric, and regional SST well, containing SST fields with more uniform variance through time and better month-to-month persistence than those in GISST. HadMAT1 is more consistent with SST and with collocated land surface air temperatures than previous NMAT data sets.},

	Abstract = {The climate response of the equatorial Pacific to increased greenhouse gases is investigated using numerical experiments from 11 climate models participating in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\&{\#}8217;s Fourth Assessment Report. Multimodel mean climate responses to CO2 doubling are identified and related to changes in the heat budget of the surface layer. Weaker ocean surface currents driven by a slowing down of the Walker circulation reduce ocean dynamical cooling throughout the equatorial Pacific. The combined anomalous ocean dynamical plus radiative heating from CO2 is balanced by different processes in the western and eastern basins: Cloud cover feedbacks and evaporation balance the heating over the warm pool, while increased cooling by ocean vertical heat transport balances the warming over the cold tongue. This increased cooling by vertical ocean heat transport arises from increased near-surface thermal stratification, despite a reduction in vertical velocity. The stratification response is found to be a permanent feature of the equilibrium climate potentially linked to both thermodynamical and dynamical changes within the equatorial Pacific. Briefly stated, ocean dynamical changes act to reduce (enhance) the net heating in the east (west). This explains why the models simulate enhanced equatorial warming, rather than El Ni\~no\&{\#}8211;like warming, in response to a weaker Walker circulation. To conclude, the implications for detecting these signals in the modern observational record are discussed. },

	Abstract = {Maps of the remotely sensed Absolute Dynamic Topography (ADT) and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) over the Eastern Mediterranean in the period June 1993 to June 2001 show a dramatic and sudden change in the sea surface structure. This change, which is presumably associated with the relaxation of the Eastern Mediterranean Transient (EMT), had taken place by the middle of 1997 and consisted of a complete reversal of the Ionian upper-layer circulation from anticyclonic to cyclonic. In the EMT phase, SST and ADT maps suggest enhanced communication between the Ionian and the Aegean basins as well as Aegean waters spreading northward along the eastern Ionian flank. Negative wind vorticity in the Ionian suggests that the switch of the upper-layer circulation from anticyclonic to cyclonic cannot be explained in terms of the wind forcing. Therefore, we suggest the predominance of the baroclinic vorticity production term in determining the upper-layer circulation inversion.},

	Abstract = {Application of biogeochemical models to the study of marine ecosystems is pervasive, yet objective quantification of these models' performance is rare. Here, 12 lower trophic level models of varying complexity are objectively assessed in two distinct regions (equatorial Pacific and Arabian Sea). Each model was run within an identical one-dimensional physical framework. A consistent variational adjoint implementation assimilating chlorophyll-a, nitrate, export, and primary productivity was applied and the same metrics were used to assess model skill. Experiments were performed in which data were assimilated from each site individually and from both sites simultaneously. A cross-validation experiment was also conducted whereby data were assimilated from one site and the resulting optimal parameters were used to generate a simulation for the second site. When a single pelagic regime is considered, the simplest models fit the data as well as those with multiple phytoplankton functional groups. However, those with multiple phytoplankton functional groups produced lower misfits when the models are required to simulate both regimes using identical parameter values. The cross-validation experiments revealed that as long as only a few key biogeochemical parameters were optimized, the models with greater phytoplankton complexity were generally more portable. Furthermore, models with multiple zooplankton compartments did not necessarily outperform models with single zooplankton compartments, even when zooplankton biomass data are assimilated. Finally, even when different models produced similar least squares model-data misfits, they often did so via very different element flow pathways, highlighting the need for more comprehensive data sets that uniquely constrain these pathways.},

	Abstract = {An observational analysis of Mediterranean Sea water cycle variability based on recently available datasets provides new insights on the long-term changes which affected the region since the 1960s. Results indicate an overall increase in evaporation during 1958\&{\#}8211;2006, with a decrease up until the mid-1970s and an increase from thereon. Precipitation variability is characterized by substantial interdecadal variations and a negative long-term trend. Evaporation increase, primarily driven by SST variability, together with precipitation decrease resulted in a substantial increase in the loss of fresh water from the Mediterranean Sea toward the overlying atmosphere. An increase in fresh water deficit is consistent with observed Mediterranean Sea salinity tendencies and has broad implications for the Mediterranean water cycle and connected systems. These observational results are in qualitative agreement with simulated Mediterranean Sea water cycle behavior from a large ensemble of CMIP3 models. However, simulated anomalies are about one order of magnitude smaller than observed. This inconsistency and the large uncertainties associated with the observational rates of change highlight the need for more research to better characterize and understand Mediterranean water cycle variations in recent decades, and better simulate crucial underlying processes in global models. },

	Abstract = {[1] An empirical method is presented for the estimation of basin-scale distribution of partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) in the North Pacific using satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a concentrations (chl a), and climatological sea surface salinity (SSS). In this approach, multiple regression equations were developed to compute mixed layer dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) based on SST, SSS and Chl a, whereas mixed layer total alkalinity (TA) was linearly regressed with SSS. The DIC-SST relation exhibited three different slopes at SST < 20 degrees, 20 degrees < SST < 27.5 degrees and SST>27.5 degrees C. Therefore data have been grouped with reference to SST. Regression equations were developed for two seasons (spring and summer). The regression errors for DIC and TA were 10.5 and 5 mu mol kg(-1), respectively. The pCO(2) was computed from the estimated DIC and TA using dissociation constants given by Mehrbach et al. (1973), refit by Dickson and Millero (1987). The derived pCO(2) agreed with the shipboard pCO(2) observations within an error of 17-23 mu atm. The sensitivity test on the regression equations for DIC estimation indicated that SSS is the most influencing parameter, followed by SST and Chl a. Using the monthly average SST and Chl a fields derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing Wide Field of view Sensor), respectively, and climatological SSS, monthly basin-scale pCO(2) fields were computed. The statistical model derived pCO(2) results are in agreement with underway pCO(2) in the North Pacific. This study strongly suggests that satellite-based techniques are promising tools for estimation of pCO(2) fields on a basin scale but the associated error bars are larger than required to study anthropogenic carbon uptake by the oceans. Incorporation of more in situ shipboard data may help in refining the estimating equations and reducing the errors further.},

	Abstract = {Determining how El Ni\~no and its impacts may change over the next 10 to 100 years remains a difficult scientific challenge. Ocean\&{\#}8211;atmosphere coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) are routinely used both to analyze El Ni\~no mechanisms and teleconnections and to predict its evolution on a broad range of time scales, from seasonal to centennial. The ability to simulate El Ni\~no as an emergent property of these models has largely improved over the last few years. Nevertheless, the diversity of model simulations of present-day El Ni\~no indicates current limitations in our ability to model this climate phenomenon and to anticipate changes in its characteristics. A review of the several factors that contribute to this diversity, as well as potential means to improve the simulation of El Ni\~no, is presented. },

	Abstract = {We found evidence that summertime surface nutrient concentration in the subarctic North Pacific (SANP), the third largest ``high-nutrient and low-chlorophyll''(HNLC) region in the world oceans, has decreased during 1975 to 2005. The observed trend seemed independent from natural decadal/interannual variations and roughly explained by the combination of multidecadal increasing trend of sea surface temperature (SST) and the observed negative correlation of nutrient concentration vs. SST. These analyses indicated that the observed decrease is mainly due to the recent stratification of the upper ocean column caused by global warming. This nutrient trend has a potential to minimize the present SANP-HNLC region by up to 25{\%}, assuming that the observed trend continues until the end of this century.},

@article{hofmann09,
	Abstract = {Rising atmospheric CO levels will not only drive future global mean temperatures toward values unprecedented during the whole Quaternary but will also lead to massive acidification of sea water. This constitutes by itself an anthropogenic planetary-scale perturbation that could significantly modify oceanic biogeochemical fluxes and severely damage marine biota. As a step toward the quantification of such potential impacts, we present here a simulation-model-based assessment of the respective consequences of a business-as-usual fossil-fuel-burning scenario where a total of 4,075 Petagrams of carbon is released into the atmosphere during the current millennium. In our scenario, the atmospheric CO level peaks at ≈1,750 μatm in the year 2200 while the sea-surface pH value drops by >0.7 units on global average, inhibiting the growth of marine calcifying organisms. The study focuses on quantifying 3 major concomitant effects. The first one is a significant (climate-stabilizing) negative feedback on rising CO levels as caused by the attenuation of biogenic calcification. The second one is related to the biological carbon pump. Because mineral ballast, notably CaCO, is found to play a dominant role in carrying organic matter through the water column, a reduction of its export fluxes weakens the strength of the biological carbon pump. There is, however, a third effect with severe consequences: Because organic matter is oxidized in shallow waters when mineral-ballast fluxes weaken, oxygen holes (hypoxic zones) start to expand considerably in the oceans in our model world---with potentially harmful impacts on a variety of marine ecosystems. },

@article{heinze04,
	Abstract = {A model scenario for the change in global marine biogenic CaCO3 export production (CaCO3 = calcium carbonate) due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide partial pressure is carried out. Findings from laboratory experiments, which suggest a decrease of biocalcification at higher pCO2, are extrapolated to the world ocean by use of the biogeochemical ocean general circulation model HAMOCC. For an A1B IPCC emission scenario and constant emission rates after year 2100, the simulation predicts a global decrease of biological CaCO3 export production by about 50{\%} in year 2250. The negative feedback due to this drop in CaCO3 export on the atmospheric CO2 concentration is small as compared to the anthropogenic CO2 emissions. This negative feedback will potentially be compensated by a shallower remineralization of organic carbon.},

@article{zubkov00,
	Abstract = {Samples were collected from the top 200 m of the water column at 50 stations during two cruises in different, near equinoctial seasons on an Atlantic transect near the 20{\{}degrees{\}}W meridian between 50{\{}degrees{\}}N and 50{\{}degrees{\}}S. These samples were analysed to determine characteristics of the heterotrophic bacterial populations. Flow cytometry was used to enumerate these bacteria and determine their average size so as to calculate their biomass. Heterotrophic bacterial production, and the rate of grazing of these bacteria by heterotrophic nanoplankton in the main depth layers, were determined using 3H thymidine and 14C leucine techniques. The biomass of heterotrophic nanoplankton in these layers was determined using a glucosaminidase assay. Five provinces were distinguished along the transect and characterized by average values of all measured parameters. The relative composition and activity of the microbial community in the water columns within each province changed little between the two cruises. Lowest heterotrophic bacterial biomass of 1-2 mg C m-3 and production of 0.1-0.2 mg C m-3 day-1 were found in the northern and southern Atlantic gyres, and were relatively similar in both seasons. Biomass and production were 2-4 times higher in the northern and southern temperate waters, and in equatorial waters, than in the gyres and tended to show more seasonal variation. Production and biomass in the layer below the pycnocline were lower by 10-30{\%} and about 50{\%}, respectively, than values determined in the surface mixed layer, and varied less with latitude. Depth-integrated values of these two parameters were generally of similar size in the mixed water layer and the layer of the chlorophyll maximum and pycnocline, and tended to vary with season. The specific growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria was in the range 0.05 to 0.12 day-1 in the top mixed layer at all latitudes. In spite of the elevated temperatures, bacterial growth appears to be restricted by a shortage of nutrients so that the microbial community cycles very slowly, with a turnover time of the order of 1 week or more. The depth-integrated biomass of heterotrophic nanoplankton was generally about 100{\%} of the heterotrophic bacterial biomass in the same water. Grazing by these nanoplankton at the rate measured could consume all of the new production of heterotrophic bacteria in all waters, and they probably control the populations of both heterotrophic and phototrophic bacteria. },

	Abstract = {The Mediterranean Sea is an important regional European Union (EU) sea, often used to assess the global change of the environment because of its practically enclosed character. As most of the northern part is bordered by the EU, it is also of interest in the evaluation of the environmental and economic impact of the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive and related legislation. Within this framework, nutrient loads from the adjacent land surfaces need to be assessed. For this purpose, the geographic information system (GIS)--interfaced hydrologic/water quality model ArcView Generalized Watershed Loading Function Model (AVGWLF) was applied to all coastal-adjacent catchments of the Mediterranean Sea. Results of this exercise have shown that the modeled average streamflow and nutrient loads fall within the ranges reported in the literature. Therefore, successful application of this model is feasible. However, for improved representation of the actual Mediterranean Sea streamflow and nutrient status, more accurate input data are required, particularly for the Asian and North African regions.},

	Abstract = {An adjoint method is applied to a three-dimensional global ocean biogeochemical cycle model to optimize the ecosystem parameters on the basis of SeaWiFS surface chlorophyll observation. We showed with identical twin experiments that the model simulated chlorophyll concentration is sensitive to perturbation of phytoplankton and zooplankton exudation, herbivore egestion as fecal pellets, zooplankton grazing, and the assimilation efficiency parameters. The assimilation of SeaWiFS chlorophyll data significantly improved the prediction of chlorophyll concentration, especially in the high-latitude regions. Experiments that considered regional variations of parameters yielded a high seasonal variance of ecosystem parameters in the high latitudes, but a low variance in the tropical regions. These experiments indicate that the adjoint model is, despite the many uncertainties, generally capable to optimize sensitive parameters and carbon fluxes in the euphotic zone. The best fit regional parameters predict a global net primary production of 36 Pg C yr−1, which lies within the range suggested by Antoine et al. (1996). Additional constraints of nutrient data from the World Ocean Atlas showed further reduction in the model-data misfit and that assimilation with extensive data sets is necessary.},

@article{dong08,
	Abstract = {Argo float profiles of temperature, salinity, and pressure are used to derive the mixed-layer depth (MLD) in the Southern Ocean. MLD is determined from individual profiles using both potential density and potential temperature criteria, and a monthly climatology is derived from individual MLDs using an objective mapping method. Quantitative data are available in the auxiliary material. The spatial structures of MLDs are similar in each month, with deep mixed layers within and just north of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) in the Pacific and Indian oceans. The deepest mixed layers are found from June to October and are located just north of the ACC where Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) and Subantarctic Mode Water ( SAMW) are formed. Examination of individual MLDs indicates that deep mixed layers ( MLD >= 400 m) from both the density and temperature criteria are concentrated in a narrow surface density band which is within the density range of SAMW. The surface salinity for these deep mixed layers associated with the SAMW formation are slightly fresher compared to historical estimates. Differences in air-sea heat exchanges, wind stress, and wind stress curl in the Pacific and Indian oceans suggest that the mode water formation in each ocean basin may be preconditioned by different processes. Wind mixing and Ekman transport of cold water from the south may assist the SAMW formation in the Indian Ocean. In the eastern Pacific, the formation of mode water is potentially preconditioned by the relative strong cooling and weak stratification from upwelling.},

@article{robinson09,
	Abstract = {Plankton production was measured using 8 techniques at 4 stations in the Celtic Sea, North Atlantic Ocean, in April 2002. Primary production (PP) was derived from C-14 incorporation into particulate carbon after 24 h simulated in situ, PP(C-14(SIS)), and 2 h photosynthesis-irradiance incubations, PP(C-14(PUR)), and from 2 published satellite algorithms, PP(VGPM) and PP(M91). Gross production (GP) was calculated from O-2 evolution, GP(O-2), and O-18 enrichment of dissolved O-2, GP(O-18), after 24 h simulated in situ incubations, and from in situ active fluorescence measured by fast repetition rate fluorometry (FRRF). Net community production (NCP) was determined from changes in in Situ dissolved oxygen, NCP(Delta O-2), and from changes in oxygen during 24 h simulated in Situ incubations, NCP(O-2). Dark community respiration (DCR) was derived from changes in oxygen during a 24 h dark incubation, DCR(O-2), and daily oxygen uptake, DOU(O-18, O-2), was calculated from the difference between GP(O-18) and NCP(O-2). Three stations were dominated by picoautotrophs and the fourth station was dominated by diatoms. While most of the comparisons between techniques fell within previously published ranges, 2 anomalies occurred only at the diatom-dominated station. Rates of PP(C-14(PUR)) were < rates of PP(C-14(SIS)), and oxygen uptake in the light was more than 10-fold > oxygen uptake in the dark. The low rates of PP(C-14(PUR)) in relation to PP(C-14(SIS)) may have resulted from the heterogeneous nature of the bloom and differences in sampling time. However, it is also possible that dissolved organic material (DOM) released by the stressed diatom population restricted the diffusion of C-14 into the cells, thereby causing a greater underestimate of PP by techniques using short incubations. The significantly higher rates of oxygen uptake in the light are difficult to reconcile, and we do not know whether the light enhanced oxygen uptake was directly linked to carbon fixation. However, the release of DOM may also have provided substrate for enhanced respiration in the light. These anomalies were only revealed through the concurrent measurement of plankton production by this wide range of techniques. Further investigation of DOM excretion and light-enhanced respiration during diatom blooms is warranted.},

	Abstract = {Verification and validation of numerical models of natural systems is impossible. This is because natural systems are never closed and because model results are always nonunique. Models can be confirmed by the demonstration of agreement between observation and prediction, but confirmation is inherently partial. Complete confirmation is logically precluded by the fallacy of affirming the consequent and by incomplete access to natural phenomena. Models can only be evaluated in relative terms, and their predictive value is always open to question. The primary value of models is heuristic.},

	Abstract = {This study presents the upgrade of the Optimal Interpolation scheme used in the basin scale assimilation scheme of the Mediterranean Forecasting System. The modifications include a daily analysis cycle, the assimilation of ARGO float profiles, the implementation of the geostrophic balance in the background error covariance matrix and the initialisation of the analyses. A series of numerical experiments showed that each modification had a positive impact on the accuracy of the analyses: The daily cycle improved the representation of the processes with the temporal variability shorter than a week, the assimilation of ARGO floats profiles significantly improved the salinity analyses quality, the geostrophically balanced background error covariances improved the accuracy of the surface elevation analyses, and the initialisation removed the barotropic adjustment in the forecast first time steps starting from the analysis.},

	Abstract = {[1] Using an intercalibrated set of oxygen data for the eastern Mediterranean, 1987 1999, we study the evolution of oxygen concentrations that accompanied the recent changes in the thermohaline circulation of this sea ( the so-called Eastern Mediterranean Transient (EMT)). We find that, by way of massively transferring oxygen-rich near-surface waters into the deep layers, the EMT by 1995 had raised oxygen concentrations considerably relative to the pre-EMT situation in 1987. Between 1995 and 1999, however, the oxygen concentrations decreased noticeably, we identify oxygen decreases of about 5 mmol/kg for the layers below 2200 m and between about 500 and 1000 m depth, for which layers previous work found vanishing or little replenishment during 1995 - 1999. Supporting evidence for absence of replenishment is obtained from the temporal evolution of tritium-He-3 ages. The oxygen decreases convert into utilization rates of approximately 1.3 mmol/(kg yr). An even higher rate, 2.3 mmol/( kg yr), is obtained for the deep waters of the Cretan Sea below 1000 m. The utilization rate found for the deepest waters significantly exceeds the pre-EMT value of 0.53 mumol/( kg yr). We propose that the massive invasion of near surface waters affected by the EMT made available large amounts of dissolved organic carbon with an unusually high fraction of labile material, which in turn enhanced oxygen consumption. Supporting evidence is obtained from data of dissolved organic carbon, and from mesozooplankton ecology data. The enhanced oxygen utilization represents a further example of EMT-related disturbances in the biogeochemistry of the eastern Mediterranean.},

	Abstract = {The increase of atmospheric CO2 concentrations due to anthropogenic activities is substantially damped by the ocean, whose CO2 uptake is determined by the state of the ocean, which in turn is influenced by climate change. We investigate the mechanisms of the ocean's carbon uptake within the feedback loop of atmospheric CO2 concentration, climate change and atmosphere/ocean CO2 flux. We evaluate two transient simulations from 1860 until 2100, performed with a version of the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) with the carbon cycle included. In both experiments observed anthropogenic CO2 emissions were prescribed until 2000, followed by the emissions according to the IPCC Scenario A2. In one simulation the radiative forcing of changing atmospheric CO2 is taken into account (coupled), in the other it is suppressed (uncoupled). In both simulations, the oceanic carbon uptake increases from 1 GT C/year in 1960 to 4.5 GT C/year in 2070. Afterwards, this trend weakens in the coupled simulation, leading to a reduced uptake rate of 10% in 2100 compared to the uncoupled simulation. This includes a partial offset due to higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the coupled simulation owing to reduced carbon uptake by the terrestrial biosphere. The difference of the oceanic carbon uptake between both simulations is primarily due to partial pressure difference and secondary to solubility changes. These contributions are widely offset by changes of gas transfer velocity due to sea ice melting and wind changes. The major differences appear in the Southern Ocean (-45%) and in the North Atlantic (-30%), related to reduced vertical mixing and North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, respectively. In the polar areas, sea ice melting induces additional CO2 uptake (+20%).},

@article{najjar07,
	Abstract = {Results are presented of export production, dissolved organic matter (DOM) and dissolved oxygen simulated by 12 global ocean models participating in the second phase of the Ocean Carbon-cycle Model Intercomparison Project. A common, simple biogeochemical model is utilized in different coarse-resolution ocean circulation models. The model mean (+/- 1 sigma) downward flux of organic matter across 75 m depth is 17 +/- 6 Pg C yr(-1). Model means of globally averaged particle export, the fraction of total export in dissolved form, surface semilabile dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and seasonal net outgassing (SNO) of oxygen are in good agreement with observation-based estimates, but particle export and surface DOC are too high in the tropics. There is a high sensitivity of the results to circulation, as evidenced by (1) the correlation of surface DOC and export with circulation metrics, including chlorofluorocarbon inventory and deep-ocean radiocarbon, (2) very large intermodel differences in Southern Ocean export, and (3) greater export production, fraction of export as DOM, and SNO in models with explicit mixed layer physics. However, deep-ocean oxygen, which varies widely among the models, is poorly correlated with other model indices. Cross-model means of several biogeochemical metrics show better agreement with observation-based estimates when restricted to those models that best simulate deep-ocean radiocarbon. Overall, the results emphasize the importance of physical processes in marine biogeochemical modeling and suggest that the development of circulation models can be accelerated by evaluating them with marine biogeochemical metrics.},

	Abstract = {CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel burning and industrial processes have been accelerating at a global scale, with their growth rate increasing from 1.1% y(-1) for 1990-1999 to >3% y(-1) for 2000-2004. The emissions growth rate since 2000 was greater than for the most fossil-fuel intensive of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emissions scenarios developed in the late 1990s. Global emissions growth since 2000 was driven by a cessation or reversal of earlier declining trends in the energy intensity of gross domestic product (GDP) (energy/GDP) and the carbon intensity of energy (emissions/energy), coupled with continuing increases in population and per-capita GDP. Nearly constant or slightly increasing trends in the carbon intensity of energy have been recently observed in both developed and developing regions. No region is decarbonizing its energy supply. The growth rate in emissions is strongest in rapidly developing economies, particularly China. Together, the developing and least-developed economies (forming 80% of the world's population) accounted for 73% of global emissions growth in 2004 but only 41% of global emissions and only 23% of global cumulative emissions since the mid-18th century. The results have implications for global equity.},

@article{canadell07,
	Abstract = {The growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)), the largest human contributor to human-induced climate change, is increasing rapidly. Three processes contribute to this rapid increase. Two of these processes concern emissions. Recent growth of the world economy combined with an increase in its carbon intensity have led to rapid growth in fossil fuel CO(2) emissions since 2000: comparing the 1990s with 2000-2006, the emissions growth rate increased from 1.3% to 3.3% y(-1). The third process is indicated by increasing evidence (P = 0.89) for a long-term (50-year) increase in the airborne fraction (AF) of CO(2) emissions, implying a decline in the efficiency of CO(2) sinks on land and oceans in absorbing anthropogenic emissions. Since 2000, the contributions of these three factors to the increase in the atmospheric CO(2) growth rate have been approximately 65 +/- 16% from increasing global economic activity, 17 +/- 6% from the increasing carbon intensity of the global economy, and 18 +/- 15% from the increase in AF. An increasing AF is consistent with results of climate-carbon cycle models, but the magnitude of the observed signal appears larger than that estimated by models. All of these changes characterize a carbon cycle that is generating stronger-than-expected and sooner-than-expected climate forcing.},

@article{gualdi08,
	Abstract = {characteristics of tropical cyclones (TCs). The analysis has been performed using scenario climate simulations carried out with a fully coupled high-resolution global general circulation model. The capability of the model to reproduce a reasonably realistic TC climatology has been assessed by comparing the model results from a simulation of the twentieth century with observations. The model appears to be able to simulate tropical cyclone-like vortices with many features similar to the observed TCs. The simulated TC activity exhibits realistic geographical distribution, seasonal modulation, and interannual variability, suggesting that the model is able to reproduce the major basic mechanisms that link TC occurrence with large-scale circulation. The results from the climate scenarios reveal a substantial general reduction of TC frequency when the atmospheric CO2 concentration is doubled and quadrupled. The reduction appears particularly evident for the tropical western North Pacific (WNP) and North Atlantic (ATL). In the NWP the weaker TC activity seems to be associated with reduced convective instabilities. In the ATL region the weaker TC activity seems to be due to both the increased stability of the atmosphere and a stronger vertical wind shear. Despite the generally reduced TC activity, there is evidence of increased rainfall associated with the simulated cyclones. Finally, the action of the TCs remains well confined to the tropical region and the peak of TC number remains equatorward of 20 degrees latitude in both hemispheres, notwithstanding the overall warming of the tropical upper ocean and the expansion poleward of warm SSTs.},

	Abstract = {Apparent Oxygen Utilization (AOU) is widely used to infer respiration in the oceans by assuming that surface oxygen concentration is close to saturation with the overlying atmosphere. However, significant disequilibrium of oxygen has been observed in high latitude surface oceans where the deep waters are formed. We explicitly calculate True Oxygen Utilization (TOU) in a global ocean physical-biogeochemical model to evaluate the ability of AOU to represent respiration. We find significant differences between AOU and TOU in the deep waters, suggesting a systematic overestimation of respiration when inferred from AOU. The surface heat flux and the entrainment of thermocline waters together drive the surface undersaturation of oxygen in the regions of water mass formation, and their influences are significantly enhanced by sea ice cover at high latitudes.},

	Abstract = {A biogeochemical ocean general circulation model, driven with NCEP-R1 and observed atmospheric CO2 history, is used to investigate and quantify the role that the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), identified as the leading mode of climate variability, has in driving interannual variability in Southern Ocean air-sea CO2 fluxes between 1980 and 2000. Our simulations show the Southern Ocean to be a region of decreased CO2 uptake during the positive SAM phase. The SAM induces changes in Southern Ocean CO2 uptake with a 2-month time lag explaining 42{\%} of the variance in the total interannual variability in air-sea CO2 fluxes. Our analysis shows that the response of the Southern Ocean to the SAM is primarily governed by changes in {\OE}{\^\i}pCO2 (67{\%}), and that this response is driven by changes in ocean physics that control the supply of nutrients to the upper ocean, primarily Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC). The SAM is predicted to become stronger and more positive in response to climate change and our results suggest this will decrease the Southern Ocean CO2 uptake by 0.1PgC/yr per unit change in the SAM.},

	Abstract = {Climate variability in the high-latitude Southern Hemisphere (SH) is dominated by the SH annular mode, a large-scale pattern of variability characterized by fluctuations in the strength of the circumpolar vortex. We present evidence that recent trends in the SH tropospheric circulation can be interpreted as a bias toward the high-index polarity of this pattern, with stronger westerly flow encircling the polar cap. It is argued that the largest and most significant tropospheric trends can be traced to recent trends in the lower stratospheric polar vortex, which are due largely to photochemical ozone losses. During the summer-fall season, the trend toward stronger circumpolar flow has contributed substantially to the observed warming over the Antarctic Peninsula and Patagonia and to the cooling over eastern Antarctica and the Antarctic plateau.},

We agree with Law et al. that network choice increases the uncertainty of trend estimates but argue that their network of five locations is too small to be reliable. A future reversal of Southern Ocean CO2 saturation as suggested by Zickfeld et al. is possible, but only at high atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and the effect would be temporary. },

	Abstract = {Based on observed atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and an inverse method, we estimate that the Southern Ocean sink of CO2 has weakened between 1981 and 2004 by 0.08 petagrams of carbon per year per decade relative to the trend expected from the large increase in atmospheric CO2. We attribute this weakening to the observed increase in Southern Ocean winds resulting from human activities, which is projected to continue in the future. Consequences include a reduction of the efficiency of the Southern Ocean sink of CO2 in the short term (about 25 years) and possibly a higher level of stabilization of atmospheric CO2 on a multicentury time scale.},

	Abstract = {A new class of phytoplankton models with a mechanistic basis has been presented in a companion paper (Baklouti, M., Diaz, F., Pinazo, C., Faure, V., Queguiner, B., 2006. Investigation of mechanistic formulations depicting phytoplankton dynamics for models of marine pelagic ecosystems. Progress in Oceanography). It is the default class of models implemented in our new numerical tool Eco3M, which is dedicated to Ecological, Mechanistic and Modular Modelling. A brief overview of its main features is given in Section 2 of the present paper. In the next sections, a particular phytoplankton model among the aforementioned class has been tested with special emphasis on the mechanistic photosynthesis component relating the photosynthetic rate to the proportion of open photosystems II. The present study encompasses several essential steps that are inherent to any modelling, including model reduction, model sensitivity analysis and comparison of model outputs with experiments. The global sensitivity analysis of the plankton model for one-at-a-time parameter perturbations revealed a restricted set of parameters having major influence on the model outputs. Sensitivity tests involving simultaneous parameter perturbations within the range actually encountered in the literature provided a confidence interval for the outputs. Chemostat experiments performed on nitrate-limited diatoms grown under low (LL) and high-light (HL) conditions have been used for comparison with model outputs. The good fit between measured data and model outputs using the same parameter values in both the LL and HL cases demonstrates the ability of our model to represent the main features of phytoplankton dynamics including photoacclimation. Finally, Eco3M is ultimately intended to include explicit bacterial and zooplankton compartments, as well as to be coupled with ocean circulation models, but the intrinsic behavior of the phytoplankton model has been investigated first, independently of physical forcing.

	Abstract = {Realistic modelling of marine ecosystems is necessary for improving our understanding of the ocean's biogeochemical state and for predicting their response to anthropic perturbations. An essential step in achieving this task is the use of mechanistic formulations to describe the biogeochemical processes involved in the dynamics of marine pelagic ecosystems. This study provides a review on some modelling strategies for some of the key processes involved in the dynamics of phytoplankton. It encompasses the most advanced work in terms of mechanistic understanding and, therefore, mainly deals with photosynthesis (including photoacclimation and photoinhibition), respiration, and nutrient uptake (including multi-limitation of algal growth by nutrients). We highlight, that in many ecosystem models, phytoplankton processes are still described more or less empirically, mainly due to a lack of biochemical knowledge, or if a mechanistic formulation exists, the parameters are often difficult to assess experimentally. As a result of this investigation, a preliminary structure for a generic phytoplankton model is delivered in the last section of this paper. This model includes a mechanistic representation of photosynthesis/photoinhibition based on photosystem II status, as well as new formulations for photoacclimation and dissolved organic matter exudation processes. The model sensitivity analysis with regard to its parameters and a comparison with chemostat experimental data are presented in a companion paper [Baklouti, M., Faure, V., Pawlowski, L., Sciandra, A., 2006. Investigation and sensitivity analysis of a mechanistic phytoplankton model implemented in a new modular numerical tool (Eco3M) dedicated to biogeochemical modelling. Progress in Oceanography]. Finally, this new class of multi-element, multi-species phytoplankton models will provide the basis for future studies on ecosystem modelling. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a scenario for understanding the unexpectedly large changes of deep waters and ther mohaline circulation in the Eastern Mediterranean during the past decade. II is demonstrated as a possible deepwater renewal mechanism in the Eastern Mediterranean in a numerical simulation with a high-resolution model, which has successfully reproduced the observed 1987 and 1995 regimes as shown by the two Meteor cruises. A budget study of the model simulation has shown that more than 75% of the salt added to the deep layers of the Eastern Mediterranean could have come from the top 1000 m by a salinity redistribution process triggered by intensive cooling over the Aegean Sea. A water transformation process analysis is carried out in the model simulation to reveal how colder and fresher dense deep water formed in the Aegean is turned into the Eastern Mediterranean Deep Water (EMDW) as observed. Surface heat and freshwater fluxes are diagnosed to show the roles of each component during the transition. About a 10% to 15% (11% or 6.6 cm yr(-1) in this experiment) increase of freshwater loss over the Eastern Mediterranean plus some cold winters, which are able to decrease the sea surface temperature in the Aegean by an additional 1 degrees-2 degrees C, would be capable of switching the major EMDW formation site from the Adriatic to the Aegean Sea and altering the EMDW structure from the pre-1987 stare to the 1995 regime as revealed by the two Meteor cruises, M5 and M31. It does not necessarily require a large increase of E - P in the Aegean itself to produce the salty bottom water observed in the Cretan Sea (the south Aegean). An increased transport of Levantine Intermediate Water (LIW) into the Aegean would increase the salinity of the Aegean bottom water, but the major salinity increase for the new EMDW occurs in the Cretan Sea where the colder but fresher Aegean bottom water meets the LIW and convects to the bottom. Such internal convection causes the temperature to drop but the salinity to rise in the deep layers of the Cretan Sea. When the Cretan deep water flows through Kasos Strait outside of the Cretan Are, it falls again to the bottom of the Levantine Basin and spreads into the Ionian Sea. During this second course of internal convection the water is diluted further before it sinks to the bottom due to mixing with old EMDW.},

	Abstract = {The Aegean water masses and circulation structure are studied via two large-scale surveys performed during the late winters of 1988 and 1990 by the R/V Yakov Gakkel of the former Soviet Union. The analysis of these data sheds light on the mechanisms of water mass formation in the Aegean Sea that triggered the outflow of Cretan Deep Water (CDW) from the Cretan Sea into the abyssal basins of the eastern Mediterranean Sea (the so-called Eastern Mediterranean Transient). It is found that the central Aegean Basin is the site of the formation of Aegean Intermediate Water, which slides southward and, depending on their density, renews either the intermediate or the deep water of the Cretan Sea. During the winter of 1988, the Cretan Sea waters were renewed mainly at intermediate levels, while during the winter of 1990 it was mainly the volume of CDW that increased. This Aegean water mass redistribution and formation process in 1990 differed from that in 1988 in two major aspects: (i) during the winter of 1990 the position of the front between the Black Sea Water and the Levantine Surface Water was displaced farther north than during the winter of 1988 and ( ii) heavier waters were formed in 1990 as a result of enhanced lateral advection of salty Levantine Surface Water that enriched the intermediate waters with salt. In 1990 the 29.2 isopycnal rose to the surface of the central basin and a large volume of CDW filled the Cretan Basin. It is found that, already in 1988, the 29.2 isopycnal surface, which we assume is the lowest density of the CDW, was shallower than the Kassos Strait sill and thus CDW egressed into the Eastern Mediterranean.},

	Abstract = {We examine 44 years (1958-2001) of model data with the aim of characterizing the low frequency (the seasonal cycle and lower) variability of surface heat fluxes. The data set was produced in the framework of the HIPOCAS project through a dynamical downscaling(1/2 degrees x 1/2 degrees) from the NCEP/NCAR global reanalysis using the atmospheric limited area model REMO. The added value of this data set is the better representation of regional and local aspects related to thermal and dynamical effects resulting from its higher resolution. The basin mean values of the heat fluxes have been estimated in 168 W/m(2) for the solar radiation (Q(S)), 73 W/m(2) for the longwave net radiation (Q(B)), 8 W/m2 for the sensible heat (Q(H)) and 88 W/m(2) for the latent heat (Q(E)), giving a total heat budget of about -1 W/m(2). The main differences with respect to previous results are the reduced Q(S) and Q(E) terms. The seasonal cycle accounts for a significant fraction of the variability (75%, 20% and 10% for Q(S), Q(E) and Q(H)) except for Q(B) (less than 1%). The total heat budget has an amplitude of 164 W/m(2) and peaks by middle June, in agreement with previous works and observations. The interannual variability of each component has been first quantified by the standard deviation of the annual mean values, obtaining +/- 2.0 W/m(2) for Q(S) +/- 1.1 W/m(2) for Q(B) +/- 4.7 W/m(2) for Q(E) and +/- 1.1 W/m(2) for Q(H). The dominant modes have been obtained through an EOF analysis, which is shown to be robust With respect to the analysis domain. The correlation between the amplitudes of the radiation terms (Q(S) and Q(B)) and MOI winter values is higher than 0.7 (in absolute value) in the Eastern basin. For the other flux components the correlation with the MOI is less than 0.7 everywhere. The correlation between the heat flux terms and the NAO is smaller than 0.7 for all terms. From the evaluation analysis, HIPCOAS fluxes show stronger cot-relations with the observation based NOC fields than are obtained with the original NCEP/NCAR fluxes for the full set of interannually varying heat flux estimates. Thus, the downscaling has led to an improved representation of the interannual variability when compared with observations. (C) 2007 Elsevier B,V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {[1] Anomalies in the air-sea heat and freshwater forcing of the eastern Mediterranean are related to observations of deep water formation in the Aegean Sea between 1987 and 1995. Fields of the buoyancy exchange (expressed as a density flux) are determined from the Southampton Oceanography Centre (SOC) flux climatology and National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis. A coherent picture emerges from the two data sets, in both cases the strongest losses occur in winters 1991-1992 and 1992-1993, when Aegean Sea net heat loss and net evaporation anomalies of 60 W m(-2) and 0.05 m month(-1), respectively, are found. These correspond to thermal and haline density fluxes of 3.3 x 10(-6) and 0.6 x 10(-6) kg m(-2) s(-1). Thus the thermal term makes the major contribution to the increase in density of the surface waters over these winters and the haline term plays only a minor role. Similar results are obtained when annual mean fields are considered as the winter forcing dominates. The NCEP/NCAR reanalysis is used to place the winters of the early 1990s in the context of variability over the longer period 1949-2002. Anomalous winter losses of similar magnitude occurred in the mid-1970s and the possibility of a related previous episode of deep water formation in the Aegean is discussed. The relationship between Aegean Sea heat loss and large-scale atmospheric pressure patterns is also investigated. Heat loss anomalies are found to be uncorrelated with the North Atlantic Oscillation. However, a strong correlation (r(2) = 0.52) is found with a pattern whose main feature is anomalously high pressure over western Europe.},

	Abstract = {[1] The role of eddies on the formation and spreading of water masses in the Western Mediterranean Sea is studied with an ocean general circulation model. The model is forced with interannually variable surface forcing for the years from 1979 to 1999. It is found that the model reproduces the major features of the observed mesoscale variability in the Gulf of Lions and the large eddies evolution in the Algerian Basin. The seasonal evolution of circulation in the Gulf of Lions and processes of spreading of newly formed intermediate deep waters in the postconvection period is studied for years 1987 and 1992. The model results are compared with data from observations. It is shown that the instability of the transition zone between old and newly formed deep waters, which takes place after the violent mixing stages of the deep convection, leads to collapse of the mixed patch and formation of mesoscale eddies. Some of these eddies propagate out of the Gulf of Lions transporting deep waters into the Algerian Basin. The rest of the mesoscale eddies filled with newly formed deep waters remain in the Gulf of Lions and tend to merge and enlarge. After the cyclonic eddies reach the Algerian Basin they interact with the intense mesoscale field existing there. The energy analysis shows that the winter and spring are seasons of intensified baroclinic instability of the mean flow in the two regions of interest, the Gulf of Lions and Algerian Basin. The kinetic energy is released by baroclinic instability in spring and summer. The spring spectra in the two regions have maximums at horizontal scales of about 80 - 100 km which is the typical scale of the eddies in the model. These eddies propagate a cyclonic circuit. The resulting eddy-induced mass transport in deep and intermediate layers is directed out of the Gulf of Lions and toward the Gibraltar Strait. Equivalently, we can argue the intermediate and deep waters conveyor belt of the Western Mediterranean Sea is eddy-driven.},

	Abstract = {The interannual variability of the Mediterranean (MED) circulation from 1979 to 1993 is studied with a 1degrees/8 x 1degrees/8 resolution OGCM. The surface forcing used is 6 hourly ECMWF (European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast) reanalysis data. Two different periods in the surface forcing and model variability are identified during 1981-1993: the first, Period 1 (1981 1987) and the second, Period 11 (1988-1993). Changes in the model response between the two periods are driven by corresponding differences in the surface forcing, which presumably are a result of the decadal scale changes of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) atmospheric regimes, related to the intensification of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) at the end of the 1980s. During the second period (1988-1993), the Mediterranean circulation reveals an overall weakening of the kinetic energy in the Western Mediterranean (WMED) basin and significant changes in the structure of circulation in the Eastern basin. In the latter region, the anticyclonic activity increases in the southern Ionian and in the southern area of the mid-Mediterranean Jet. These anticyclonic eddies, present during different years of Period 11 with variable intensity, have an important impact on the transport of Modified Atlantic Waters (MAW) and Levantine Intermediate Waters (LIW) in the Eastern Mediterranean (EMED). This change of the circulation modified the salinity and the amount of Levantine Intermediate Waters transported towards the Aegean Sea and the Adriatic Sea, which are important factors for deep water formation processes there. These model results are in good agreement with available observational results. The deep water formation event observed in the Aegean Sea [Science 271 (1996) 333] is produced by the model, but at a shallower depth. We interpret this event as the result of circulation changes between Period I and Period 11 and anomalous surface atmospheric forcing over the Aegean Sea. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

	Abstract = {The eastern Mediterranean (Levantine Basin) hydrography and circulation are investigated by comparing the results of a high-resolution primitive equation model with observations. After a 10-year integration, the model is able to reproduce the major water masses and the circulation patterns of the eastern Mediterranean. Comparisons with the POEM hydrographical observations show good agreement. The vertical distribution of the water masses matches that of the observations quite well in terms of monthly mean. The model surface circulation is in agreement with circulation schemes derived from recent observations. Some well-known mesoscale features of the upper thermocline circulation are also realistically reproduced. In agreement with satellite observations, the model shows that high-energy mesoscale eddies dominate the upper thermocline circulation in the southern and the central parts of the Levantine Basin. Most of the Atlantic Water follows the north African coast and forms a strong coastal jet near the Libyan coast rather than forming the Mid-Mediterranean Jet described by several authors. The sub-basin circulation shows a strong seasonal signal. A strong and stable current flows along the isobaths in winter, becoming weaker and with more meanders in summer. The mesoscale eddies throughout the whole basin are more energetic in summer than in winter. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Predicting the evolution of climate over decadal timescales requires a quantitative understanding of the dynamics that govern the meridional overturning circulation (MOC). Comprehensive ocean measurement programmes aiming to monitor MOC variations have been established in the subtropical North Atlantic (RAPID, at latitude 26.5 degrees N, and MOVE, at latitude 16 degrees N) and show strong variability on intraseasonal to interannual timescales. Observational evidence of longer-term changes in MOC transport remains scarce, owing to infrequent sampling of transoceanic sections over past decades. Inferences based on long-term sea surface temperature records, however, supported by model simulations, suggest a variability with an amplitude of +/-1.5-3 Sv (1 Sv = 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) on decadal timescales in the subtropics. Such variability has been attributed to variations of deep water formation in the sub-arctic Atlantic, particularly the renewal rate of Labrador Sea Water. Here we present results from a model simulation that suggest an additional influence on decadal MOC variability having a Southern Hemisphere origin: dynamic signals originating in the Agulhas leakage region at the southern tip of Africa. These contribute a MOC signal in the tropical and subtropical North Atlantic that is of the same order of magnitude as the northern source. A complete rationalization of observed MOC changes therefore also requires consideration of signals arriving from the south.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the interannual variability of the Mediterranean Sea thermohaline circulation under present climate conditions using an oceanic model of 1/8¬∞resolution. Two numerical simulations of 50 year duration were performed. In a control simulation the model was forced by a perpetual year forcing inferred from the climatology of the ECMWF fields, while in a random simulation the 6 years of the ECMWF fields were randomly applied. In this way we were able to test the sensitivity of the thermohaline circulation under an atmospheric interannual variability. In particular, during the last 10 years of the random simulation a succession of cold winters led to anomalous deep water formation in the Aegean Sea. We focused our analysis on this event. This anomalously dense water mostly forms in the Central and Southern Aegean subbasins with a formation rate of about 0.6 Sv. This led to strong modifications in water mass budgets and circulation with intensified exchanges between these two subbasins. The export of those dense waters to the Levantine basin remains weak except for a few particular years. Thus the impact of this event is localized as opposed to the Eastern Mediterranean Transient. These results show the possibility for transient events to reoccur in the Eastern basin in the forthcoming years.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in observational and theoretical studies of El Nino have shed light on controversies concerning the possible effect of global warming on this phenomenon over the past few decades and in the future. El Nino is now understood to be one phase of a natural mode of oscillation-La Nina is the complementary phase-that results from unstable interactions between the tropical Pacific Ocean and the atmosphere. Random disturbances maintain this neutrally stable mode, whose properties depend on the background (time-averaged) climate state. Apparent changes in the properties of El Nino could reflect the importance of random disturbances, but they could also be a consequence of decadal variations of the background state. The possibility that global warming is affecting those variations cannot be excluded.},

	Abstract = {Four related approaches for assessing model goodness-of-fit (GOF) are discussed in this paper: linear regression of observed versus predicted values, the sum of squared prediction errors, a reliability index summarizing predictions as being within a factor K-s of observed values, and correlation-like measures of fit that normalize the sum of squared prediction error to be between zero and one. Relationships among the four measures are derived and alternative decompositions of the measures into components relating to bias, variance, and consistency are presented. The measures are extended to include lack-of-fit terms when multiple observations are available for each prediction, and except for the reliability index, extended to include the multivariate case of multiple prediction variables. Application of the GOF measures to model predictions and observed radon-222 concentrations (a univariate example) showed significant lack-of-fit for high concentrations. Application of the GOF measures to predicted and observed mean lengths and densities of winter flounder larvae (a multivariate example) showed predicted densities were good with most of the lack-of-fit attributed to similar to 0.44 mm bias in predicted mean lengths. The role of GOF analysis in evaluating model performance is discussed.},

@article{dore08,
	Abstract = {The export of organic matter from the oceanic euphotic zone is a critical process in the global biogeochemical cycling of bioelements (C, N, P, Si). Much of this export occurs in the form of sinking particles, which rain down into the unlit waters of the deep sea. Classical models of oceanic production and export balance this gravitational loss of particulate bioelements with an upward flux of dissolved nutrients, and they describe reasonably well those areas of the ocean where deep winter mixing occurs. The surface waters of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG), however, are strongly stratified and chronically nutrient-depleted, especially in summer. Nevertheless, there is ample evidence that blooms of phytoplankton and subsequent pulses of particle export occur during the height of summer stratification in these waters, especially to the northeast of the Hawaiian Islands. These blooms impact regional bioelemental cycling and act as a food source to the deep-sea benthos. We review here numerous published observations of these events in the NPSG, and present new data collected at Station ALOHA (22.75 degrees N, 158 degrees W) during the first 176 cruises of the Hawaii Ocean Time-series program (1988-2005), along with results from transect cruises conducted in the region in 1996 and 2005. We suggest that the summer phytoplankton bloom can be considered a frequent, perhaps annual feature in the northeastern NPSG, and that its perceived stochastic nature is a manifestation of chronic undersampling in time and space. The bloom is typically dominated by only a few genera of large diatoms and the cyanobacterium. Trichodesmium. It appears to be consistently supported by dinitrogen fixation, but the fate of the organic matter produced during the summer depends critically on the species composition of the responsible diazotrophs. We estimate that the summer bloom is responsible for up to 38% of N-2 fixation and up to 18% of N-based new production annually at Station ALOHA. We hypothesize that the spatial distribution, timing and magnitude of the bloom may be determined largely by the physical and biological processes controlling new phosphorus delivery into the euphotic zone during the summer and the preceding winter.

	Abstract = {The third primary production algorithm round robin (PPARR3) compares output from 24 models that estimate depth-integrated primary production from satellite measurements of ocean color, as well as seven general circulation models (GCMs) coupled with ecosystem or biogeochemical models. Here we compare the global primary production fields corresponding to eight months of 1998 and 1999 as estimated from common input fields of photosynthetically-available radiation (PAR), sea-surface temperature (SST), mixed-layer depth, and chlorophyll concentration. We also quantify the sensitivity of the ocean-color-based models to perturbations in their input variables. The pair-wise correlation between ocean-color models was used to cluster them into groups or related output, which reflect the regions and environmental conditions under which they respond differently. The groups do not follow model complexity with regards to wavelength or depth dependence, though they are related to the manner in which temperature is used to parameterize photosynthesis. Global average PP varies by a factor of two between models. The models diverged the most for the Southern Ocean, SST under 10 degrees C, and chlorophyll concentration exceeding 1 mg Chlm(-3). Based on the conditions under which the model results diverge most, we conclude that current ocean-color-based models are challenged by high-nutrient low-chlorophyll conditions, and extreme temperatures or chlorophyll concentrations. The GCM-based models predict comparable primary production to those based on ocean color: they estimate higher values in the Southern Ocean, at low SST, and in the equatorial band, while they estimate lower values in eutrophic regions (probably because the area of high chlorophyll concentrations is smaller in the GCMs). Further progress in primary production modeling requires improved understanding of the effect of temperature on photosynthesis and better parameterization of the maximum photosynthetic rate.

	Abstract = {The response of the phytoplankton and bacterial spring succession to the predicted warming of sea surface temperature in temperate climate zones during winter was studied using an indoor-mesocosm approach. The mesocosms were filled with winter water from the Kiel Fjord, Baltic Sea. Two of them were started at similar to 2 degrees C and the temperature was subsequently increased according to the decadal temperature profile of the fjord (Delta T 0 degrees C, baseline treatment). The other mesocosms were run at 3 elevated temperatures with differences of Delta T +2, +4 and +6 degrees C. All mesocosms were exposed to the same light conditions. Timing of peak phytoplankton primary production (PP) during the experimental spring bloom was not significantly influenced by increasing temperatures, whereas the peak of bacterial secondary production (BSP) was accelerated by about 2 d per degrees C. This suggests that, in case of warming, the spring peak of bacterial degradation of organic matter (in terms of BSP) would occur earlier in the year. Furthermore, the lag time between the peaks of PP and BSP (about 16 d for Delta T 0 degrees C) would diminish progressively at elevated temperatures. The average ratio between BSP and PP increased significantly from 0.33 in the coldest mesocosms to 0.63 in the warmest ones. Community respiration and the contribution of picoplankton (<3 mu m fraction) to this also increased at elevated temperatures. Our results lead to the prediction that climate warming during the winter/early spring in temperate climate zones will favor bacterial degradation of organic matter by tightening the coupling between phytoplankton and bacteria. However, if PP is reduced by warming, as in our experiments, this will not necessarily lead to increased recycling of organic matter (and CO2).},

	Abstract = {Bacterial numbers and production, and abundance of heterotropic nanoplankton [HNAN] were recorded over 24 h at the core and boundary of the Cyprus Eddy, a warm-core eddy in the Levantine Basin of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The basin is known as one of the most oligotrophic on record. Bacterial numbers in the euphotic zone were close to the lower threshold value for bacterial abundance in the oceans, with means of 2.7 x 10(5) bacteria ml-1 at the boundary and 4.9 x 10(5) ml-1 at the core. Bacterial production, measured as the rate of DNA labelling by thymidine (TdR), ranged from 0.01 to 0.70 pmol TdR l-1 h-1, values which fall at the lower end of ranges reported from other freshwater and marine ecosystems. No diel cycles of bacterial numbers or rate of TdR incorporation were observed, but the TdR rate normalized to cell numbers showed marked diel variation with the highest rates usually found in early morning hours. HNAN were characteristically small (mostly < 3-mu-m in diameter) and more abundant in the core (37 to 850 cells ml-1) than in the boundary station (19 to 414 cells ml-1). The long bacterial doubling times (ca 50 d), and the parallel distribution of bacteria and HNAN, suggested low grazing pressure. A possible alternative food source for HNAN is prochlorophytes. Higher microbial standing crop and activity are anticipated in the core of the eddy in winter, when deep mixing occurs.},

	Abstract = {Heterotrophic bacterial abundance and productivity were measured during five and four cruises, respectively, in the northwest Arabian Sea as part of the US JGOFS Process Study, which provided a new view of seasonal bacterial dynamics in that part of the basin influenced by monsoonal forcing. In this paper, surface layer data are used to address two questions concerning the influence of the monsoon cycle on bacterial dynamics: (1) Is there a bacterial bloom in the SW Monsoon? and (2) Is bacterial production low during the oligotrophic Spring Intermonsoon? An extensive comparison of epifluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, unprecedented at this scale, detected essentially the same heterotrophic bacterial populations and distributions, with some between-cruise differences. Use of the two methods allowed us to extend our observations in space and time. Bacterial productivity, both in the surface layer and integrated over the euphotic zone, was elevated less than 2-fold during the Southwest Monsoon. Levels of bacterial abundance and production were low during the Northeast Monsoon, then increased in March during the Spring Intermonsoon. There was some stimulation of abundance or production inshore in response to coastal upwelling. In general, the basin was enriched in bacterial biomass > 5 x 10(8) cells 1(-1) throughout the year, relative to other tropical regimes, presumably in response to overall high PP and DOC levels. Seasonally uniform DOC levels may be regulated in part by intense bacterial utilization rates, but also reflect seasonal consistency in PP. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) commenced monthly sampling in October 1988 as part of the US Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) program. The goals of the US JGOFS time-series research are to better understand the basic processes that control ocean biogeochemistry on seasonal to decadal time-scales, determine the role of the oceans in the global carbon budget, and ultimately improve our ability to predict the effects of climate change on ecosystems. The BATS program samples the ocean on a biweekly to monthly basis, a strategy that resolves major seasonal patterns and interannual variability. The core cruises last 4-5 d during which hydrography, nutrients, particle flux, pigments and primary production, bacterioplankton abundance and production, and often complementary ancillary measurements are made. This overview focuses on patterns in ocean biology and biogeochemistry over a decade at the BATS site, concentrating on seasonal and interannual changes in community structure, and the physical forcing and other factors controlling the temporal dynamics. Significant seasonal and interannual variability in phytoplankton and bacterioplankton production, biomass, and community structure exists at BATS. No strong relationship exists between primary production and particle flux during the 10 yr record, with the relationship slightly improved by applying an artificial lag of 1 week between production and flux. The prokaryotic picoplankton regularly dominate the phytoplankton community; diatom blooms are rare but occur periodically in the BATS time series. The increase in Chi a concentrations during bloom periods is due to increases by most of the taxa present, rather than by any single group, and there is seasonal succession of phytoplankton. The bacterioplankton often dominate the living biomass, indicating the potential to consume large amounts of carbon and play a major ecological role within the microbial food web. Bacterial biomass, production, and specific growth rates are highest during summer. Size structure and composition of the plankton community may be an important factor controlling the quality of dissolved organic matter produced and could affect production of bacterioplankton biomass. Larger heterotrophic plankton play an integral role in the flux of material out of the euphotic zone at BATS. Protozoans are abundant and can constitute a sizable component of sinking flux. Zooplankton contribute significantly to flux via production of rapidly sinking fecal pellets, and vertically migrating zooplankton can actively transport a significant amount of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon and nitrogen to deep water. An important question that remains to be further addressed at BATS is how larger climatological events drive some of the interannual variability in the biogeochemistry.

	Abstract = {It has been proposed that net primary production (NPP), net community production (NCP), particulate organic carbon export (Phi(POC)) and the relationships among them are governed by local environmental conditions that favor either a microbially dominated assemblage leading to a regeneration loop (low ratio of (Phi(POC) to NPP) or a system dominated by large plankton with export pathway characteristics (high ratio of (Dpoc to NPP). We analyze more than 10 years of data from two subtropical time-series stations (Hawaii Ocean Times-series (HOT) in the North Pacific, and Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series (BATS) in the North Atlantic) in order to investigate this regeneration loop versus export pathway hypothesis and in particular to test the idea that the switch between the two is controlled by enhanced input of nutrients. In the decadal long-term mean, the relationships between NPP, (Dpoc and NCP, which we take here as a proxy for export production, reveal export pathway characteristics at BATS, while HOT is dominated by the regeneration loop. This difference is consistent with the stronger seasonal forcing at BATS and the resulting higher new nutrient input. However, these characteristics are only valid for parts of the year. Especially at BATS, the export pathway exists only in spring and the system reverts to a regeneration loop in summer and fall. This is consistent with our hypothesis given the strong summer-time stratification and the resulting low levels of new nutrient input. On interannual time-scales, we find little evidence for statistically significant alterations of the long-term mean characteristics, a finding we ascribe to a combination of limited magnitude of forcing, length of the data records, and possibly an inherent lack of predictability. A comparison of our results for the ratio between NCP and NPP (e-ratio) and the ratio between Phi(POC) and NPP (pe-ratio) with those predicted by the models of Laws et al. [Temperature effects on export production in the open ocean. Global Biogeochemical Cycles 14(4), 1231-1246] and Dunne et al. [Empirical and mechanistic models for particle export ratio. Global Biogeochemical Cycles 19, GB40261 respectively, show reasonable agreement for the long-term mean, but these models fail to capture the observed interannual variability in these ratios.

	Abstract = {A primary production model, specific to the subtropical North Pacific, was developed using productivity and chlorophyll data collected at Station ALOHA (22.75 degreesN, 158.00 degreesW) and measured phytoplankton physiological parameters. The production algorithm is a mechanistic, full spectral model that provides depth-dependent photosynthesis rates. Six years of phytoplankton pigment data were analyzed to derive seasonal cycles and to parameterize chlorophyll a (Chl; monovinyl and divinyl chlorophyll a) versus depth profiles. The Chi profiles fit a Gaussian-type distribution with depth over a constant background concentration equal to mixed-layer values. Maximum Chi concentrations were always found below the surface, and the parameters displayed distinct monthly and seasonal patterns. Photosynthesis versus irradiance experiments were conducted at a number of locations and seasons in the vicinity of Station ALOHA to calculate phytoplankton physiological parameters needed for the computation of primary production rates. Relationships were explored between environmental conditions and the physiological and profile parameters in order to develop algorithms based on remotely sensed sea-surface variables and time of year. These relationships were used to model primary production rates using data collected during the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program. The performance of the model and model parameters were tested by comparing modeled results to those measured directly at Station ALOHA by trace metal-clean, in situ C-14 incubation techniques. Monthly averaged chlorophyll profile parameters and a constant maximum quantum yield (0.026 mol C (molquanta)(-1)) generates an annual production estimate of 168 g Cm-2, which closely resembles that measured at Station ALOHA (181g C m(-2)) during the same period. The measured and modeled primary production rates for the subtropical North Pacific are twice as high as values derived from Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) data (60-90gCm(-2)) during the period 1978-1986. If the study area near Station ALOHA is representative of most oligotrophic waters, current global estimates of primary production rates have been significantly underestimated.

	Abstract = {Gross community production (GCP) and dark community respiration (DCR) rates were measured in the N.E. Atlantic Basin (38-45 degrees N and 15 degrees 20'-21 degrees 20'W) during the Programme Oceanographique Multidisciplinaire Meso-Echelle (POMME). Three cruises were conducted over a one-year period (2001), and GCP and DCR were measured at 20 stations using seawater taken from 5 m. In winter, GCP is light limited whereas DCR, which is mainly due to bacteria, is limited by substrate availability. GCP and DCR were under the influence of mesoscale features, with the cyclonic structure enhancing the autotrophy. In spring, light and resource availability remain the major controlling parameters, which are constrained by north-south zonation, rather than mesoscale features. The most productive area is south of 41 degrees N at the start of the bloom and is associated with greater DCR as autotrophs contribute to community respiration. The late-summer period is oligotrophic, which contrasts with the previous winter and spring period, characterised by a large quantity of TOC accumulated (+ 13.2 mu M C from spring to late-summer) and with greater DCR in the southern area. The GCP/DCR ratio greatly varied seasonally, ranging from 0.6 in late summer to 1.3 in winter and 2.4 in spring. These results, even restricted to surface ecosystem metabolism (5 in), strongly suggest that the trophic status of a regional system in the open ocean should be determined over a seasonal cycle.

@article{hoppe02,
	Abstract = {The oceanic carbon cycle is mainly determined by the combined activities of bacteria and phytoplankton, but the interdependence of climate, the carbon cycle and the microbes is not well understood. To elucidate this interdependence, we performed high-frequency sampling of sea water along a north-south transect of the Atlantic Ocean. Here we report that the interaction of bacteria and phytoplankton is closely related to the meridional profile of water temperature, a variable directly dependent on climate. Water temperature was positively correlated with the ratio of bacterial production to primary production, and, more strongly, with the ratio of bacterial carbon demand to primary production. In warm latitudes (25 degrees N to 30 degrees S), we observed alternating patches of predominantly heterotrophic and autotrophic community metabolism. The calculated regression lines (for data north and south of the Equator) between temperature and the ratio of bacterial production to primary production give a maximum value for this ratio of 40% in the oligotrophic equatorial regions. Taking into account a bacterial growth efficiency of 30%, the resulting area of net heterotrophy (where the bacterial carbon demand for growth plus respiration exceeds phytoplankton carbon fixation) expands from 8 degrees N (27 degrees C) to 20 degrees S (23 degrees C). This suggests an output of CO2 from parts of the ocean to the atmosphere.},

	Abstract = {Mesozooplankton are significant consumers of phytoplankton, and have a significant impact on the oceanic biogeochemical cycles of carbon and other elements. Their contribution to vertical particle flux is much larger than that of microzooplankton, yet most global biogeochemical models have lumped these two plankton functional types together. In this paper we bring together several newly available data syntheses on observed mesozooplankton concentration and the biogeochemical fluxes they mediate, and perform data synthesis on flux rates for which no synthesis was available. We update the equations of a global biogeochemical model with an explicit representation of mesozooplankton (PISCES). We use the rate measurements to constrain the parameters of mesozooplankton, and evaluate the model results with our independent synthesis of mesozooplankton concentration measurements. We also perform a sensitivity study to analyze the impact of uncertainty in the flux rates. The standard model run was parameterized on the basis of the data synthesis of flux rates. The results of mesozooplankton concentration in the standard run are slightly lower than the independent databases of observed mesozooplankton concentrations, but not significantly. This shows that structuring and parameterizing biogeochemical models on the basis of observations without tuning is a strategy that works. The sensitivity study showed that by using a maximum grazing rate of mesozooplankton that is only 30{\%} higher than the poorly constrained fit to the observations, the model mesozooplankton concentration gets closer to the observations, but mesozooplankton grazing becomes higher than what is currently accounted for. This is an indication that food selection by mesozooplankton is not sufficiently quantified at present. Despite the amount of effort that is represented by the data syntheses of all relevant processes, the good results that were obtained for mesozooplankton indicate that this effort needs to be applied to all components of marine biogeochemistry. The development of ecosystem models that better represent key plankton groups and that are more closely based on observations should lead to better understanding and quantification of the feedbacks between marine ecosystems and climate.},

@article{vichi08,
	Abstract = {The response of phytoplankton growth to iron supply and its modulation by large-scale circulation and tropical instability waves (TIWs) in the eastern equatorial Pacific has been investigated with an ocean biogeochemical model. This process study shows that iron can be efficiently advected from the New Guinea shelf through the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) to the eastern Pacific. The presence of a continental iron source is necessary for the maintenance of the observed subsurface iron maximum in the EUC core. In the eastern Pacific region, phytoplankton production is enhanced when additional iron is available in the EUC. Simulated phytoplankton variability is linked to TIWs activity, as revealed by a wavelet analysis of the total autotrophic carbon. The net local effect of the waves on phytoplankton can be either positive or negative depending on several factors. When the iron nutricline is sufficiently shallow to be reached by the wave vertical scale, the effect of the waves is to enhance iron availability in the euphotic zone leading to a net local increase of phytoplankton biomass. We therefore suggest that the local maxima of phytoplankton observed in moorings off the Equator in the eastern Pacific might be not only the result of concentration mechanisms, but also the result of an increase in local production sustained by advected iron.},

	Abstract = {The long-term changes in the thermohaline circulation and water mass characteristics of the Mediterranean Sea caused by the damming of the Nile in 1964 are investigated using a 3-D primitive equation model (Princeton Ocean Model, POM). The model is first integrated for 65 years under climatological forcing and without taking into account the Nile runoff to obtain an initial steady state. Then the model is integrated for 75 years with the Nile outflow included until it reaches a steady state representative of that existing in the Mediterranean prior to the damming. Finally, the model is integrated for another 75 years eliminating the Nile runoff to reach a new steady state. The model results show that the absence of the Nile freshwater input induces a saltier surface layer in the vicinity of the Rhodes Gyre thus favoring the preconditioning for the formation of the Levantine Intermediate Water (LIW). This results in about 30% increase of the LIW formation rate. Intermediate waters become saltier, and as they are transported westward they reduce the stability of the water column in the deep-water formation sites, namely the South Adriatic and the Gulf of Lions. Thus saltier and larger amounts of dense waters are formed filling the deep parts of the Mediterranean Sea. According to the model, the Nile damming explains about 45% of the observed salinity increasing trend occurring over the last 40 years in the Western Mediterranean Deep Water (WMDW). Furthermore, model results demonstrate that the Nile damming played a crucial role in the long-term salt preconditioning of the surface/intermediate layers of the Cretan Sea, thus contributing in triggering the Eastern Mediterranean climatic transient in the late 1980s.},

	Abstract = {The equatorial Pacific Ocean is one of the most important yet highly variable oceanic source areas for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Here, we used the partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2), measured in surface waters from 1979 through early 2001, to examine the effect on the equatorial Pacific CO2 chemistry of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation phase shift, which occurred around 1988 to 1992. During the decade before the shift, the surface water PCO2 (corrected for temperature changes and atmospheric CO2 uptake) in the central and western equatorial Pacific decreased at a mean rate of about -20 microatm per decade, whereas after the shift, it increased at about +15 microatm per decade. These changes altered the CO2 sink and source flux of the equatorial Pacific significantly.},

	Abstract = {The absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) into the ocean lowers the pH of the waters. This so-called ocean acidification could have important consequences for marine ecosystems. To better understand the extent of this ocean acidification in coastal waters, we conducted hydrographic surveys along the continental shelf of western North America from central Canada to northern Mexico. We observed seawater that is undersaturated with respect to aragonite upwelling onto large portions of the continental shelf, reaching depths of approximately 40 to 120 meters along most transect lines and all the way to the surface on one transect off northern California. Although seasonal upwelling of the undersaturated waters onto the shelf is a natural phenomenon in this region, the ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 has increased the areal extent of the affected area.},

	Abstract = {{This study presents the distribution of dissolved inorganic carbon
   (DIC) along the Strait of Gibraltar, its tidal-induced variability, as
   well as the inorganic carbon exchange between the Atlantic Ocean and
   Mediterranean Sea. During November 2003, water column samples were
   collected at nine stations to measure total alkalinity (TA), pH, and
   dissolved oxygen (DO) for the spatial characterization of the carbonate
   system. At the same time, anchored samplings were carried out, above
   the Camarinal Sill and in the Eastern Section of the Strait, in order
   to assess the tidal mixing effects for oxygen and DIC distribution on
   the water column. Three distinct water masses can be discerned in this
   area: the Surface Atlantic Water (SAW), the Mediterranean Water (MW),
   and the less abundant North Atlantic Central Water (NACW). The
   observations show an increase in the DIC and a decrease in oxygen
   concentration with depth, related to the different physico-chemical
   features of each water mass. The results show the high time-dependence
   of the vertical distribution of DIC with the interface oscillation,
   affected by the intense mixing processes taking place in the Strait.
   Intense mixing episodes over the Camarinal Sill are responsible for an
   increase in the DIC concentrations in the upper layer of the Eastern
   Section of the Strait. Higher DIC concentrations in the Mediterranean
   than in the Atlantic waters are responsible for a net DIC transport of
   1.47 x 10(12) mol Cyr(-1) to the Atlantic Ocean. Nevertheless, the net
   exchange is highly sensitive to the interface definition, as well as to
   the estimate of water volume transport used. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

	Abstract = {{Total alkalinity (AT) was measured during the Meteor 51/2 cruise,
   crossing the Mediterranean Sea from west to east. AT concentrations
   were high (similar to 2600 mu mol kg(-1)) and
   alkalinity-salinity-correlations had negative intercepts. These results
   are explained by evaporation coupled with high freshwater AT inputs
   into coastal areas. Salinity adjustment of AT revealed excess
   alkalinity throughout the water column compared to mid-basin surface
   waters. Since Mediterranean waters are supersaturated with respect to
   calcite and aragonite, the excess alkalinity likely reflects alkalinity
   inputs to coastal areas close to regions of deep and intermediate water
   formation. An alkalinity budget shows that main alkalinity inputs come
   from the Black Sea and from rivers, whereas the Strait of Gibraltar is
   a net sink. The major sink appears to be carbonate sedimentation. The
   basin-average net calcification rate and CaCO3 sedimentation was
   estimated to be 0.38 mol m(-2) yr(-1). The estimated residence time of
   AT is similar to 160 yr.}},

	Abstract = {{We compiled from literature annually integrated air-water fluxes of
   carbon dioxide (CO2) computed from field measurements, in 20 coastal
   European environments that were gathered into 3 main ecosystems: inner
   estuaries, upwelling continental shelves and non-upwelling continental
   shelves. The comparison of annual cycles of the partial pressure of CO2
   (pCO(2)) in 5 contrasting continental shelves provided insights into
   the biogeochemical drivers of the CO2 fluxes. The latter were also
   investigated by comparing CO2 fluxes to net ecosystem (NEP) and net
   community production (NCP) in 3 contrasted coastal ecosystems.
   Air-water CO2 fluxes were scaled at European regional level and
   compared to fluxes of atmospheric CO2 in other aquatic and terrestrial
   compartments. Continental shelves are significant sinks for atmospheric
   CO2 at an average rate of -1.9 molC m(-2) yr(-1) that scaled at
   European level corresponds to an absorption of atmospheric CO2 of -68.1
   TgC yr(-1). This sink is equivalent to the one reported for the
   terrestrial biosphere of -66.1 TgC yr(-1), based on carbon-stock change
   models. Estuaries are significant sources of CO2 to the atmosphere at
   an average rate of 49.9 molC m(-2) yr(-1) that is higher than the CO2
   emission to the atmosphere from rivers, streams and lakes. The scaled
   emission of CO2 to the atmosphere from inner estuaries of about 67.0
   TgC yr(-1) would almost fully balance the sink of atmospheric CO2
   computed for continental shelves. However, the scaled emission of CO2
   from estuaries to the atmosphere is inconsistent with the potential
   emission of CO2 based on the fate of river organic carbon during
   estuarine transit. This discrepancy is most probably due to the poorly
   constrained surface area estimate of inner estuaries. (c) 2006 Elsevier

	Abstract = {{During the CANIGO Project pH(T) and total alkalinity (A(T)) and
   continuous underway fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO(2)) measurements
   were carried out in the Strait of Gibraltar in September 97 and
   February 98. The pH values describe the most representative water
   masses in the area, including the Levantine Intermediate Water (7.86)
   and West Mediterranean Deep Water (7.89). The linear relationships
   between the alkalinity (at all depths) and TIC (below the euphotic
   zone) with salinity were determined (A(T) = 2353 (+/-0.4) + 92.28
   (+/-0.31) (S-36.0), r(2) = 0.998 and C-T = 2119 (+/-1.4) + 79.52
   (+/-0.76) (S-36.0), r(2) = 0.991). A net alkalinity outflow of
   -1.90+/-0.04 mol yr(-1) was estimated. The normalised alkalinity and
   total inorganic carbon were higher in the Mediterranean waters than in
   the Atlantic. The Mediterranean seawater in the 200-400 m range shows
   higher C-T values East (2323 mumol kg(-1)) rather than the West (2301
   mumol kg(-1)) of the Strait of Gibraltar, which is related to mixing
   processes through the interface layer. Measures of fCO(2) indicate
   that, in September 97, surface waters in the Strait of Gibraltar were
   acting as a source Of CO2 Of 3+/-8 mmol m(-2) day(-1). The fCO(2)
   variation in surface water has been explained considering the
   contribution of dynamic processes, thermodynamic processes, exchange
   between air and seawater and biological processes. The seasonal fCO(2)
   data record for the Strait of Gibraltar indicates that this coastal
   environment acts as a net sink for atmospheric CO2 The annual average
   flux of atmospheric CO2 into surface seawater is estimated to be -2.5
   mol m(-2) yr(-1). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

	Abstract = {{The distribution of primary production (PP), particulate carbon export
   from the photic zone to deeper layer, and nutrient concentrations are
   investigated in the Mediterranean Sea (MS) during May-June 1996. A
   decrease in integrated primary production, particulate carbon export
   and nutrient availability towards the eastern part of the Mediterranean
   sea was observed while integrated chlorophyll a remains rather
   constant. This pattern may be explained both by the adaptation of
   phytoplanktonic organisms to low light conditions and by a more
   efficient nutrient diffusion from the deeper layer in the east related
   to the position of the nutricline and density gradient. Integrated
   primary production ranging from 350 to 450 mgC m(-2) day(-1) in the
   west decreases toward the east to a value of about 150 mgC m(-2)
   day(-1). The latter value may appear as a limit for primary production
   rates under strong oligotrophic conditions. Particulate carbon export
   represents 4.0 + 2.9\% of integrated primary production. Up to 90-95\%
   of primary production is then sustained by internal recycling of
   organic matter. Evidence of a limitation of production by phosphate was
   obtained from differences between depth of nitracline and phosphacline
   and by enrichment experiments. The wide range of oligotrophic
   conditions in the Mediterranean Sea provides a case study for links

   during September 1997 in the northern and southern parts of Aegean Sea
   and analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC) by using a high temperature
   catalytic oxidation method. Our results indicate that TOC
   concentrations decreased from the surface to deep waters from 52-128 to
   48-56 muM C in the North and from 55-87 to 47-56 muM C in the South.
   Standing stocks of TOC in the upper 100 in, ranged from 6300 to 9120
   mmol C m(-2) in the North and from 6563 to 7483 mmol C m(-2) in the
   South. Basically, higher concentrations were observed in the North and
   particularly for waters where the signature of Black Sea water was more
   pronounced. From salinity TOC relationships, we estimated that TOC
   input from the Marmara and Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea through
   the Dardanelles Strait varied from 1.6 to 23.7 x 10(10) mol C year(-1).
   Our computations of TOC budget suggest that TOC inflow through
   Dardanelles Strait, is slightly lower than TOC input from Mediterranean
   rivers and from the atmosphere, whereas it is one order of magnitude
   lower than that reported for the Atlantic Ocean via the Gibraltar
   Strait. We also discuss the distribution of TOC in relation to
   bacterial production (BP) and associated bacterial carbon demand (BCD).
   Assuming a bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) of 0.30, BCD in the upper
   100 m was on average 18.1 mmol C m(-2) day(-1) in the North and 15.5
   mmol C m(-2) day(-1) in the South. Turnover times of excess TOC
   (calculated as the difference between surface water TOC and a mean
   value of TOC below 200 m) in the upper 100 in were higher in the
   northern basin (0.28-0.59 years; av. 0.47 years) than in the central
   Aegean basin (0.20 years) and the southern basin (0.20-0.36 years; av.
   0.28 years). These results may vary and need to be cautiously taken
   into account because of the uncertainties associated to the BGE.
   However, this study indicates that bacterial cycling of TOC is more
   effective in the South Aegean than in the North, which leads to a
   higher accumulation of TOC in North Aegean surface waters. (C) 2002

   and other water properties were performed monthly during a 2-year
   period from February 1998 through February 2000, at a station in the
   open northwestern Mediterranean Sea (Dyfamed Station). On seasonal
   timescale, the pCO(2) minimum of 300 muatm in winter was followed by an
   increase of 120 muatm (pCO(2) reaching 420 muatm) related to warming of
   surface waters in summer. Estimates of the underlying processes
   (mixing, biological activity and air-sea gas exchange) governing the
   monthly variations of the upper layer PC02 were obtained from observed
   variations in total inorganic carbon content (TCO2) in the surface, and
   from the vertical distribution of physical parameters and TCO2, Monthly
   variations in TCO2 due to gas exchange were determined from wind speed
   and from the air-sea PC02 gradient. The impact of biological activity
   was estimated from the difference between the observed variations in
   TCO2 and the evaluations of air-sea exchange and carbon supply by
   physical processes. Mixing at the base of the mixed layer counteracts
   the late winter to summer TCO2 drawdown (about 80 mmol m(-3)) due to a
   net organic production of about 100 mmol m(-3). The carbon consumption
   continues until early summer despite the absence of nutrients in the

   layer during the warming period exceeds by a factor of 1.6 the carbon
   production deduced from nitrate fluxes and using the usual Redfield C:N
   ratio of 6.6:1. The TCO2 increase during the autumn is primarily
   associated with convective vertical mixing induced by upper layer
   cooling and deepening. On the other hand, the contribution of air-sea
   gas exchange to TCO2 variations remains relatively small aside from
   summer months, when the CO2 oversaturation is high and the mixed layer

   of the Ligurian-Provencal Basin of the Mediterranean made it possible
   to assess the vertical distributions (5-2000 m) and the seasonal
   variations of these properties. Alkalinity varies linearly with
   salinity between surface water and the Levantine Intermediate Water
   (marked by a maximum of temperature and salinity). In deep water, total
   alkalinity is also correlated linearly to salinity, but the slope of
   the regression line is 15\% less. In surface water, the pH at
   25degreesC varies between 7.91 and 8.06 on the total proton scale
   depending upon the season. The lowest values are observed in winter,
   the highest in spring and in summer. These variations are primarily due
   to biological production. The pH goes through a minimum around 150-200m
   and a small maximum below the intermediate water. The total dissolved
   inorganic carbon content (deduced from pH and alkalinity) is variable
   in surface water (2205-2310 mumol kg(-1)) and has a maximum in
   intermediate water, which is related to the salinity maximum.
   Normalized total inorganic carbon at a constant salinity is strongly
   negatively correlated with pH at 25degreesC. The fugacity of CO2,
   (fCO(2)) varies between 320 and 430 muatm in surface water, according
   to the season. Below the seasonal thermocline, the maximum fCO(2)
   (about 410 muatm) is located around 150-200 m. The presence of a
   minimum of oxygen in the intermediate water of this area has been
   observed for several years, but our measurements made it possible to
   specify the relationship between oxygen and salinity in deep water.
   Data from the intense vertical mixing during the winters of 1999 and
   2000 were used to calculate the oxygen quantity exchanged with the
   atmosphere during these periods. The estimated quantity of oxygen
   entering the Mediterranean Sea exceeds that deduced from exchange
   coefficients calculated with the formula of Wanninkhof and McGillis.
   During the vertical mixing in the 1999 winter, fCO(2) in surface water
   was on average below equilibrium with atmospheric fCO(2), thus implying
   that CO2 was entering the sea. However, on this time scale, even with
   high exchange coefficients, the estimated CO2 uptake had no significant
   influence on the inorganic carbon content in the water column. (C) 2002

   to a maximum of approximately 510 mu atm. While the Delta fCO(2) shows
   strong variations on seasonal timescales, the annual average air-sea
   disequilibrium is only 2 mu atm. Temperature-normalized fCO(2) shows a
   continued decrease in dissolved CO2 throughout the summer and fall at a
   rate of approximately 0.6 mu atm d(-1). The calculated annual air-sea
   CO2 transfer rate is -0.10 to -0.15 moles CO2 m(-2) y(-1), with these
   low values reflecting the relatively weak wind speed regime and small

   results are used in a two-layer model of water mass exchange through
   the Strait, which includes the Atlantic inflow, the Mediterranean
   outflow and the interface laver in between. Our observations show a
   decrease of TOC and an increase of CT concentrations from the surface
   to the bottom: 71-132 muM C and 2068-2150 mu mol kg(-1) in the Surface
   Atlantic Water, 74-95 muM C and 2119-2148 mu mol kg(-1) in the North
   Atlantic Central Water, 63-116 muM C and 2123-2312 mu mol kg(-1) in the
   interface layer, and 61-78 muM C and 2307-2325 mu mol kg(-1) in the

   due to the mixing between the Atlantic inflow and the Mediterranean
   outflow on the west of the Strait. which results in a flux of organic
   carbon from the inflow to the outflow and an opposite flux of inorganic
   carbon. We estimate that the TOC input from the Atlantic Ocean to the

	Abstract = {{The Mediterranean Sea provides a case study not only for dense water
   formation and climatic functioning at a basin scale, but also as a body
   of water evolving in response to the effects of environmental changes,
   Through marine circulation, marine signatures of changes may be used to
   provide estimates of the evolution of the external driving forces of
   climate and environment. That is to say, to provide a coupling between
   marine sciences and climatic and socio-economic studies. Different
   examples may be given: i) nutrients and trace metal changes in the
   western Mediterranean permit quantification of external changes at a
   basin scale; ii) sapropels (organic-rich layers sedimented in anoxic
   conditions) provide records for the last 2 million years of
   interactions between marine circulation, climate and biology; iii)
   temperature and salinity changes that have taken place since the 1960s
   in response to changes in hear and water budgets across the sea
   surface. Sapropel studies and ongoing changes in temperature and
   salinity also require that the Mediterranean functioning be considered
   in relation to global climate and to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as
   taking into account the changing role of salty Mediterranean waters in
   the Atlantic Ocean, These factors highlight a dual role for the
   Mediterranean Sea, which acts as a miniature ocean for physical,
   chemical or climatic and environmental studies, and also as a key
   factor in understanding global ocean circulation in which past changes
   have taken place, (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

	Abstract = {{At great scales of time and space, the dynamics of the Mediterranean
   Sea, a concentration basin, are mainly linked to its freshwater budget.
   This budget is subject to evolutions due to man's use of freshwater and
   to climatic changes affecting precipitation and/or evaporation. Marine
   dynamics and Atlantic, atmospheric and terrestrial inputs are strong
   constraints for the geochemical behaviour of the Mediterranean Sea.
   From measurements made during the last decades in the deep western
   water, it appeared that temperature, salinity, nutrients and trace
   metal concentrations were changing with time. In spite of its depth,
   the Mediterranean Sea looks like a coastal ocean, according to its
   coast length, watershed and number of inhabitants and to its fast
   response to climatic and environmental changes. The changes discovered
   in deep homogeneous waters are signatures of evolutions occurred in the
   surface layer. But in this layer and particularly in coastal waters,
   climatic and/or environmental trends may be masked by seasonal and
   interannual variabilities of not only physical and chemical
   characteristics but also climatic forcing or anthropic inputs. Analyses
   of river runoff, atmospheric inputs or climatic trends together with
   marine evolutions indicate constraints concerning probable changes in
   the coastal sea and/or in the surface water and processes involved at
   the interfaces. Moreover, changes observed in coastal or deep-water
   constitute new constraints for the modelling of the marine circulation
   and the transfer of matter.}},

	Abstract = {{Alkalinity and salinity are linearly correlated in the waters of the
   most western part of the Mediterranean Sea, Nevertheless, the specific
   alkalinity of the saltier Mediterranean waters is higher than that of
   the less saline water of Atlantic origin. This may be explained by
   alkalinity input from rivers and the Black Sea. In the hypothesis of a
   steady state, the relationship between alkalinity and salinity permits
   calculation of the net flux of alkalinity between the Mediterranean Sea
   and the Atlantic Ocean, provided the water budget of the Mediterranean
   is known. The sources (rivers and the Black Sea) and sinks (seafloor)
   of alkalinity in the Mediterranean balance the net alkalinity transport
   into the Atlantic, if the water deficit of the Mediterranean is 2.2 x
   10(12) m3 yr-1 or 88 cm yr-1 per unit area. The budget of carbon in the
   Mediterranean Sea is more difficult to assess as the sources and sinks
   are numerous and not well-documented. There is particularly a lack of
   data on the seasonal variations in the inorganic and organic carbon
   concentrations in the region of the strait of Gibraltar and on the
   partial pressure of CO2 in surface water of the Mediterranean Sea. It
   appears nevertheless that there is an important flux of inorganic
   carbon from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic due to the supply of
   carbon by the rivers and the Black Sea and to the transformation of
   40\% of the organic carbon entering the Mediterranean in inorganic
   carbon. Moreover, the Mediterranean is likely a sink for the
   atmospheric carbon.}},

	Abstract = {The Antarctic Vostok ice core provided compelling evidence of the nature of climate, and of climate feedbacks, over the past 420,000 years. Marine records suggest that the amplitude of climate variability was smaller before that time, but such records are often poorly resolved. Moreover, it is not possible to infer the abundance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from marine records. Here we report the recovery of a deep ice core from Dome C, Antarctica, that provides a climate record for the past 740,000 years. For the four most recent glacial cycles, the data agree well with the record from Vostok. The earlier period, between 740,000 and 430,000 years ago, was characterized by less pronounced warmth in interglacial periods in Antarctica, but a higher proportion of each cycle was spent in the warm mode. The transition from glacial to interglacial conditions about 430,000 years ago (Termination V) resembles the transition into the present interglacial period in terms of the magnitude of change in temperatures and greenhouse gases, but there are significant differences in the patterns of change. The interglacial stage following Termination V was exceptionally long--28,000 years compared to, for example, the 12,000 years recorded so far in the present interglacial period. Given the similarities between this earlier warm period and today, our results may imply that without human intervention, a climate similar to the present one would extend well into the future.},

	Abstract = {[1] Recent observations in the eastern Mediterranean have revealed not only significant changes to the temperature and salinity structure of the deep waters, but an uplifting of the thermocline which has been accompanied by altered distributions of biogeochemical species such as dissolved nutrients and oxygen. This letter presents results from a fully coupled high resolution physical and biogeochemical cycling model which reproduces the eastern Mediterranean transient event. The impact of the event on both biogeochemical tracer distributions and modelled export production between 1987 and 1995 is investigated and compared with available observations. When run on with climatological conditions after 1995, the model suggests the transient event has little impact on export production in the basin.},

	Abstract = {We provide evidence of large-scale changes in the biogeography of calanoid copepod crustaceans in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean and European shelf seas. We demonstrate that strong biogeographical shifts in all copepod assemblages have occurred with a northward extension of more than 10 degrees latitude of warm-water species associated with a decrease in the number of colder-water species. These biogeographical shifts are in agreement with recent changes in the spatial distribution and phenology detected for many taxonomic groups in terrestrial European ecosystems and are related to both the increasing trend in Northern Hemisphere temperature and the North Atlantic Oscillation.},

	Abstract = {Regime shifts are abrupt changes between contrasting, persistent states of any complex system. The potential for their prediction in the ocean and possible management depends upon the characteristics of the regime shifts: their drivers (from anthropogenic to natural), scale (from the local to the basin) and potential for management action (from adaptation to mitigation). We present a conceptual framework that will enhance our ability to detect, predict and manage regime shifts in the ocean, illustrating our approach with three well-documented examples: the North Pacific, the North Sea and Caribbean coral reefs. We conclude that the ability to adapt to, or manage, regime shifts depends upon their uniqueness, our understanding of their causes and linkages among ecosystem components and our observational capabilities.},

@article{caddy05,
	Abstract = {The management of marine fisheries needs to undergo dramatic change in the new millennium, in response to the well-documented evidence of global overfishing and the general depletion of commercial fish stocks. The axioms of sustainable development and equilibrium productivity of wild ecosystems are identified as misleading concepts, which nonetheless underlie current approaches to the management of living marine resources. Current trends in marine fisheries landings worldwide provide little evidence of sustainability of marine resources under current management paradigms, where biological, economic and social aspects of fisheries are usually treated as different disciplines. While open-access conditions are less widespread than formerly, except for many straddling and highly migratory resources, fishers usually have access to the resource year-round throughout its range. Despite quotas, the nominal control of capacity and technical measures protecting juveniles, top-down management has generally been unable to prevent stock depletion, particularly of the older spawners that for demersal stocks often support recruitment. An integrated solution to the complexity of managing wild resources seems not to have been achieved. Any new paradigm should assert the basic unpredictability of fisheries at the system level and require a broader range of performance indicators to be incorporated into the decisional framework. This must reflect the non-equilibrium nature of marine systems, and give greater importance to resource (as opposed to harvest) continuity in the face of regime shifts, and promote habitat restoration and conservation of genetic resources.The new management framework requires co-management and collective decision-making to be incorporated within a precautionary and pre-negotiated management framework. This must explicitly recognize that decision-making occurs in conditions of model-based uncertainty and precautionary approaches should be incorporated at all levels, not least of which is to avoid the assumption that all resources can be harvested in a sustainable fashion through time. Redundancy in data inputs to management are needed to avoid the surprises that model-based sampling occasionally leads to, for example, when regime changes reduce productivity in response to climatic fluctuations. Emergency frameworks imposing non-discretionary rules must be invoked when overfishing and/or regime change trigger reference points indicating stock depletion. Non-discretionary recovery plans should then override rights-based systems and persist until fish populations recover to pre-established healthy levels, which may in turn need to await the return of a favourable regime.In fact, some stocks may require periodic rebuilding after regime-induced collapses or because of a combination of ecological or economic impacts, hence a constant harvest policy may not always be possible. It will probably also be necessary to discard the axiom that a stock should be available to harvesting throughout its range and seasonal cycle. Technological advances mean that time- and area-specific access rights are now practical options, through satellite monitoring of vessel operations, even offshore. More fundamentally, the basic axiom of "enlightened self interest" underlying current methods of management will need to be tempered by an increased ethical concern for the fragility of natural ecosystems.},

	Abstract = {Ecological surprises, substantial and unanticipated changes in the abundance of one or more species that result from previously unsuspected processes, are a common outcome of both experiments and observations in community and population ecology. Here, we give examples of such surprises along with the results of a survey of well-established field ecologists, most of whom have encountered one or more surprises over the course of their careers. Truly surprising results are common enough to require their consideration in any reasonable effort to characterize nature and manage natural resources. We classify surprises as dynamic-, pattern-, or intervention-based, and we speculate on the common processes that cause ecological systems to so often surprise us. A long-standing and still growing concern in the ecological literature is how best to make predictions of future population and community dynamics. Although most work on this subject involves statistical aspects of data analysis and modeling, the frequency and nature of ecological surprises imply that uncertainty cannot be easily tamed through improved analytical procedures, and that prudent management of both exploited and conserved communities will require precautionary and adaptive management approaches.},

We developed an ecosystem-specific, multiscale spatial model to synthesize 17 global data sets of anthropogenic drivers of ecological change for 20 marine ecosystems. Our analysis indicates that no area is unaffected by human influence and that a large fraction (41%) is strongly affected by multiple drivers. However, large areas of relatively little human impact remain, particularly near the poles. The analytical process and resulting maps provide flexible tools for regional and global efforts to allocate conservation resources; to implement ecosystem-based management; and to inform marine spatial planning, education, and basic research.},

	Abstract = {North Sea environmental and biological data were analysed to examine 30-year changes in production and consumption in the fish foodweb. The analysis revealed that the demand for secondary production placed on the ecosystem by fish declined from approximately 20 g C m-2 y-1 in the 1970s to 16 g C m-2 y-1 in the 1990s. Over the same period, the proportion of demand provided by zooplankton production increased from around 70{\%} to 75{\%}. The overall decrease was mainly due to a reduction in piscivorous demersal fish. Average secondary production by omnivorous zooplankton was estimated to be 35 g C m-2 y-1, and annual fluctuations were positively correlated with the gross production of planktivorous fish. The results suggest a "bottom-up" control of the pelagic foodweb. Individual planktivore species have been impacted by fishing, but the populations of other functionally similar species have expanded to fill the vacant niches, thus maintaining the planktivore role in the system. In contrast, the results indicate that benthos production was more "top-down" controlled. Overall, demersal fish species have been depleted by fishing, with no obvious species expansions to fill the vacant niche, releasing the benthos from predation pressure, and leading to an increase in benthic production and fisheries for invertebrates. },

	Abstract = {Since the 1990s, phytoplankton biomass on the continental shelf of Nova Scotia and in the Labrador Sea has undergone sustained changes in the spring and fall, which are accompanied by changes in bacterioplankton that are dampened in amplitude but coherent in the direction of change. A reversal of trend in biomass change, so-called sign switching, occurs both in time and in space. Thus, whenever (spring or fall) and wherever (Scotian Shelf or Labrador Sea) phytoplankton increase or decrease, so also does bacterioplankton. This tandem sign switch indicates coupling of the trophic levels at a multiyear time scale and contributes to an ecological fingerprint of systemwide forcing. },

@article{fangohr07,
	Abstract = {One of the dominant sources of uncertainty in the calculation of air-sea flux of carbon dioxide on a global scale originates from the various parameterizations of the gas transfer velocity, k, that are in use. Whilst it is undisputed that most of these pararneterizations have shortcomings and neglect processes which influence air-sea gas exchange and do not scale with wind speed alone, there is no general agreement about their relative accuracy. The most widely used parameterizations are based on non-linear functions of wind speed and, to a lesser extent, on sea surface temperature and salinity. Processes such as surface film damping and whitecapping are known to have an effect on air-sea exchange. More recently published pararneterizations use friction velocity, sea surface roughness, and significant wave height. These new parameters can account to some extent for processes such as film damping and whitecapping and could potentially explain the spread of wind-speed based transfer velocities published in the literature. We combine some of the principles of two recently published k pararneterizations [Glover, D.M., Frew, N.M., McCue, S.J. and Bock, E.J., 2002. A multiyear time series of global gas transfer velocity from the TOPEX dual frequency, normalized radar backscatter algorithm. In: Donelan, M.A., Drennan, W.M., Saltzman, E.S., and Warminkhof, R. (Eds.), Gas Transfer at Water Surfaces, Geophys. Monograph 127. AGU,Washington, DC, 325-331; Woolf, D.K., 2005. Parameterization of gas transfer velocities and sea-state dependent wave breaking. Tellus, 5713: 87-94] to calculate k as the sum of a linear function of total mean square slope of the sea surface and a wave breaking parameter. This separates contributions from direct and bubble-mediated gas transfer as suggested by Woolf [Woolf, D.K., 2005. Parameterization of gas transfer velocities and sea-state dependent wave breaking. Tellus, 5713: 87-94] and allows us to quantify contributions from these two processes independently. We then apply our parameterization to a monthly TOPEX altimeter gridded 1.5 degrees x 1.5 degrees data set and compare our results to transfer velocities calculated using the popular wind-based k parameterizations by Wanninkhof [Wanninkhof, R., 1992. Relationship between wind speed and gas exchange over the ocean. J. Geophys. Res., 97: 7373-7382.] and Warminkhof and McGillis [Warminkhof R. and McGillis, W., 1999. A cubic relationship between air-sea CO2 exchange and wind speed. Geophys. Res. Lett., 26(13): 1889-1892]. We show that despite good agreement of the globally averaged transfer velocities, global and regional fluxes differ by up to 100%. These discrepancies are a result of different spatio-temporal distributions of the processes involved in the parameterizations of k, indicating the importance of wave field parameters and a need for further validation.

	Abstract = {It is important to examine the parameterizations used in calculating air-sea exchange fluxes as they are essential in developing global carbon models and in carbon budget calculations. We quantify the potential biases involved in the parameterizations. Adopting a non-zero gas transfer velocity for low wind areas results in a significant increase in the CO2 flux in equatorial regions with a net increase of +0.2 Pg C yr(-1) in the total sea-air global flux. The ocean "cool skin temperature'' effect on CO2 flux estimation is found to be an order of magnitude smaller than early estimations. The previously unknown salty-skin effect has an opposite contribution that cancels the cool-skin effect. Comparing different wind speeds derived from satellite data and Global Circulation Models (GCM), the most significant divergence is found at the low wind equatorial regions regarding the CO2 flux estimation.},

	Abstract = {River discharge across the Mediterranean catchment basin is investigated by means of an extensive dataset of historical monthly time series to represent at-best discharge into the sea. Results give an annual mean river discharge into the Mediterranean of 8.1 x 10(3) m(3) s(-1), or at most a value that should not exceed 10.4 x 10(3) m(3) s(-1). The seasonal cycle has an amplitude of 5 x 10(3) m(3) s(-1), with a dry season in midsummer and a peak flow in early spring. Dominant contributions are from Europe with a climatological annual mean of 5.7 x 10(3) m(3) s(-1). Discharge in the Adriatic Sea, the Gulf of Lion, and the Aegean Sea together account for 62% of Mediterranean discharge, which mostly occurs in the Adriatic (2.7 x 10(3) m(3) s(-1)). The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) impacts Mediterranean discharge primarily in winter, with most river discharges across the Mediterranean catchment being anticorrelated with the NAO. Related winter anomalies are about 10%-20% of the winter means. During the period 1960-90, Mediterranean winter discharge as a whole may have undergone year-to-year NAO-related variations of up to 26% of the seasonal mean, while about 17% on decadal time scales. These variations are expected to have occurred mostly in the Gulf of Lion and the Adriatic Sea, together with the Balearic Sea, where the impact of the NAO is greatest. },

	Abstract = { We characterized decadal changes in the amplitude and shape of the
   seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 with three kinds of analysis. First,
   we calculated the trends in the seasonal cycle of measured atmospheric
   CO2 at observation stations in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration Climate Monitoring and Diagnostic Laboratory network.
   Second, we assessed the impact of terrestrial ecosystems in various
   localities on the mean seasonal cycle of CO2 at observation stations
   using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach terrestrial biosphere model
   and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) atmospheric tracer
   transport model, Third, we used the GISS tracer model to quantify the
   contribution of terrestrial sources and sinks to trends in the seasonal
   cycle of atmospheric CO2 for the period 1961-1990, specifically
   examining the effects of biomass burning, emissions from fossil fuel
   combustion, and regional increases in net primary production (NPP). Our
   analysis supports results from previous studies that indicate a
   significant positive increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of
   CO2 at Arctic and subarctic observation stations. For stations north of
   55 degrees N the amplitude increased at a mean rate of 0.66% yr(-1)
   from 1981 to 1995. From the analysis of ecosystem impacts on the mean
   seasonal cycle we find that tundra, boreal forest, and other northern
   ecosystems are responsible for most of the seasonal variation in CO2 at
   stations north of 55 degrees N. The effects of tropical biomass burning
   on trends in the seasonal cycle are minimal at these stations, probably
   because of strong vertical convection in equatorial regions. From 1981
   to 1990, fossil fuel emissions contributed a trend of 0.20% yr(-1) to
   the seasonal cycle amplitude at Mauna Loa and less than 0.10% yr(-1) at
   stations north of 55 degrees N. To match the observed amplitude
   increases at Arctic and subarctic stations with NPP increases, we find
   that north of 30 degrees N a 1.7 Pg C yr(-1) terrestrial sink would be
   required. In contrast, over regions south of 30 degrees N, even large
   NPP increases and accompanying terrestrial sinks would be insufficient
   to account for the increase in high-latitude amplitudes.},

	Abstract = {A scenario of the Mediterranean Sea is performed for the twenty-first century based on an ocean modelling approach. A climate change IPCC-A2 scenario run with an atmosphere regional climate model is used to force a Mediterranean Sea high-resolution ocean model over the 1960-2099 period. For comparison, a control simulation as long as the scenario has also been carried out under present climate fluxes. This control run shows air-sea fluxes in agreement with observations, stable temperature and salinity characteristics and a realistic thermohaline circulation simulating the different intermediate and deep water masses described in the literature. During the scenario, warming and saltening are simulated for the surface (+3.1 degrees C and + 0.48 psu for the Mediterranean Sea at the end of the twenty-first century) and for the deeper layers (+1.5 degrees C and + 0.23 psu on average). These simulated trends are in agreement with observed trends for the Mediterranean Sea over the last decades. In addition, the Mediterranean thermohaline circulation (MTHC) is strongly weakened at the end of the twenty-first century. This behaviour is mainly due to the decrease in surface density and so the decrease in winter deep-water formation. At the end of the twenty-first century, the MTHC weakening can be evaluated as -40% for the intermediate waters and -80% for the deep circulation with respect to present-climate conditions. The characteristics of the Mediterranean Outflow Waters flowing into the Atlantic Ocean are also strongly influenced during the scenario.},

@article{moran06,
	Abstract = {The history of the Arctic Ocean during the Cenozoic era (0-65 million years ago) is largely unknown from direct evidence. Here we present a Cenozoic palaeoceanographic record constructed from >400 m of sediment core from a recent drilling expedition to the Lomonosov ridge in the Arctic Ocean. Our record shows a palaeoenvironmental transition from a warm 'greenhouse' world, during the late Palaeocene and early Eocene epochs, to a colder 'icehouse' world influenced by sea ice and icebergs from the middle Eocene epoch to the present. For the most recent approximately 14 Myr, we find sedimentation rates of 1-2 cm per thousand years, in stark contrast to the substantially lower rates proposed in earlier studies; this record of the Neogene reveals cooling of the Arctic that was synchronous with the expansion of Greenland ice (approximately 3.2 Myr ago) and East Antarctic ice (approximately 14 Myr ago). We find evidence for the first occurrence of ice-rafted debris in the middle Eocene epoch (approximately 45 Myr ago), some 35 Myr earlier than previously thought; fresh surface waters were present at approximately 49 Myr ago, before the onset of ice-rafted debris. Also, the temperatures of surface waters during the Palaeocene/Eocene thermal maximum (approximately 55 Myr ago) appear to have been substantially warmer than previously estimated. The revised timing of the earliest Arctic cooling events coincides with those from Antarctica, supporting arguments for bipolar symmetry in climate change.},

Palaeorecords provide contradictory evidence about marine productivity in this region, but beyond one glacial cycle, data were sparse. Here we present continuous chemical proxy data spanning the last eight glacial cycles (740,000 years) from the Dome C Antarctic ice core. These data constrain winter sea-ice extent in the Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean biogenic productivity and Patagonian climatic conditions. We found that maximum sea-ice extent is closely tied to Antarctic temperature on multi-millennial timescales, but less so on shorter timescales. Biological dimethylsulphide emissions south of the polar front seem to have changed little with climate, suggesting that sulphur compounds were not active in climate regulation. We observe large glacial-interglacial contrasts in iron deposition, which we infer reflects strongly changing Patagonian conditions. During glacial terminations, changes in Patagonia apparently preceded sea-ice reduction, indicating that multiple mechanisms may be responsible for different phases of CO2 increase during glacial terminations. We observe no changes in internal climatic feedbacks that could have caused the change in amplitude of Antarctic temperature variations observed 440,000 years ago.},

	Abstract = {The instrumental record of Antarctic sea ice in recent decades does not reveal a clear signature of warming despite observational evidence from coastal Antarctica. Here we report a significant correlation (P < 0.002) between methanesulphonic acid (MSA) concentrations from a Law Dome ice core and 22 years of satellite-derived sea ice extent (SIE) for the 80 degrees E to 140 degrees E sector. Applying this instrumental calibration to longer term MSA data (1841 to 1995 A.D.) suggests that there has been a 20% decline in SIE since about 1950. The decline is not uniform, showing large cyclical variations, with periods of about 11 years, that confuse trend detection over the relatively short satellite era.},

@article{stephens00,
	Abstract = {Ice-core measurements indicate that atmospheric CO2 concentrations during glacial periods were consistently about 80 parts per million lower than during interglacial periods. Previous explanations for this observation have typically had difficulty accounting for either the estimated glacial O2 concentrations in the deep sea, 13C/12C ratios in Antarctic surface waters, or the depth of calcite saturation; also lacking is an explanation for the strong link between atmospheric CO2 and Antarctic air temperature. There is growing evidence that the amount of deep water upwelling at low latitudes is significantly overestimated in most ocean general circulation models and simpler box models previously used to investigate this problem. Here we use a box model with deep-water upwelling confined to south of 55 degrees S to investigate the glacial-interglacial linkages between Antarctic air temperature and atmospheric CO2 variations. We suggest that low glacial atmospheric CO2 levels might result from reduced deep-water ventilation associated with either year-round Antarctic sea-ice coverage, or wintertime coverage combined with ice-induced stratification during the summer. The model presented here reproduces 67 parts per million of the observed glacial-interglacial CO2 difference, as a result of reduced air-sea gas exchange in the Antarctic region, and is generally consistent with the additional observational constraints.},

	Abstract = {Twenty years ago, measurements on ice cores showed that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was lower during ice ages than it is today. As yet, there is no broadly accepted explanation for this difference. Current investigations focus on the ocean's 'biological pump', the sequestration of carbon in the ocean interior by the rain of organic carbon out of the surface ocean, and its effect on the burial of calcium carbonate in marine sediments. Some researchers surmise that the whole-ocean reservoir of algal nutrients was larger during glacial times, strengthening the biological pump at low latitudes, where these nutrients are currently limiting. Others propose that the biological pump was more efficient during glacial times because of more complete utilization of nutrients at high latitudes, where much of the nutrient supply currently goes unused. We present a version of the latter hypothesis that focuses on the open ocean surrounding Antarctica, involving both the biology and physics of that region.},

Before 430,000 yr B.P., partial pressure of atmospheric CO2 lies within the range of 260 and 180 parts per million by volume. This range is almost 30{\%} smaller than that of the last four glacial cycles; however, the apparent sensitivity between deuterium and CO2 remains stable throughout the six glacial cycles, suggesting that the relationship between CO2 and Antarctic climate remained rather constant over this interval. },

	Abstract = {A bio-geochemical classification of the N. Atlantic Basin is presented according to which the basin is first divided into four primary algal domains: Polar, West-Wind, Trades and Coastal. These are in turn sub-divided into smaller provinces. The classification is based on differences in the physical environment which are likely to influence regional algal dynamics. The seasonally-differentiated parameters of the photosynthesis-light curve (P-l curve) and parameters that define the vertical structure in chlorophyll profile are then established for each province, based on an analysis of an archive of over 6000 chlorophyll profiles, and over 1800 P-I curves. These are then combined with satellite-derived chlorophyll data for the N. Atlantic, and information on cloud cover, to compute primary production at the annual scale, using a model that computes spectral transmission of light underwater, and spectral, photosynthetic response of phytoplankton to available light. The results are compared with earlier, satellite-derived, estimates of basin-scale primary production.},

Our model required information about the subsurface distribution of chlorophyll, the parameters of the photosynthesis-light relationship, the sun angle and cloudiness. The computations were partitioned among 57 biogeochemical provinces that were specified from regional oceanography and by examination of the chlorophyll fields. Making different assumptions about the overestimation of chlorophyll by the CZCS in turbid coastal areas, the global net primary production from phytoplankton is given as 45-50 Gt C year(-1). This may be compared with current published estimates for land plants of 45-68 Gt C year(-1) and for coastal vegetation of 1.9 Gt C year(-1).},

	Abstract = {Recent papers have highlighted the differences between the absorption characteristics of phytoplankton populations dominated by diatoms and those of other types of phytoplankton populations from the North West Atlantic. It has been suggested that these differences could introduce a bias in satellite-derived concentrations of the phytoplankton pigment, chl a. In this paper, these differences in optical properties of diatoms are exploited to develop a bio-optical algorithm to distinguish diatom populations from other types of phytoplankton populations in the region. The algorithm is applied to SeaWiFS data on ocean colour, and the results are compared with in situ data on phytoplankton population types based on HPLC data. The comparison shows that the algorithm successfully distinguishes between diatoms and non-diatom populations in the majority of cases studied. A branching algorithm is then applied to the satellite data to estimate chl a concentration in the region: a diatom-specific algorithm is used when diatoms are identified in a pixel, and another algorithm for mixed populations when this is not the case. The estimated chl a concentrations are compared with in situ estimates when matching observations exist. The results show that the branching bio-optical algorithm often performs better than the OC4 algorithm used in standard processing of SeaWiFS data. However, the results may be poor when the initial identification of population types is wrong. Finally, the new algorithm is used to map the distribution of diatoms in the region in spring and summer: the patterns that emerge are consistent with the known features of diatom distributions in the region.},

	Abstract = {Pigment indices were used to characterise the seasonal succession of phytoplankton, and associated changes in chlorophyll a and accessory pigments, in subtropical waters of the three ocean basins in the southern hemisphere. Diagnostic indices revealed the dominance of small flagellates and elevated biomass during winter-spring in the Pacific, mixed flagellate prokaryote communities and intermediate biomass during early summer in the Atlantic, and prokaryote dominance with low biomass in mid-summer in the Indian Ocean. Photo-pigment indices indicated only a small variation in the chlorophyll a proportion of total pigments across the ocean basins, but the accessory pigments varied considerably. Under low temperature and irradiance conditions, the photosynthetic carotenoids were prominent, but as temperatures and irradiance increased and nutrients declined, there was a significant increase in the proportion of photoprotective carotenoids. At high temperatures and irradiances, the photoprotective carotenoids were the largest component of the pigment pool, exceeding the proportion of chlorophyll a. These variations in phytoplankton composition, and their photoacclimation status, could be explained according to environmental changes and have implications for satellite estimations of biomass and primary production.

	Abstract = {In the California Current System, strong mesoscale variability associated with eddies and meanders of the coastal jet play an important role in the biological productivity of the area. To assess the dominant timescales of variability, a wavelet analysis is applied to almost nine years (October 1997 to July 2006) of 1-km-resolution, 5-day-averaged, Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration data. The dominant periods of chlorophyll variance, and how these change in time, are quantified as a function of distance offshore. The maximum variance in chlorophyll occurs with a period of similar to 100-200 days. A seasonal cycle in the timing of peak variance is revealed, with maxima in spring/summer close to shore (20 km) and in autumn/winter 200 km offshore. Interannual variability in the magnitude of chlorophyll variance shows maxima in 1999, 2001, 2002, and 2005. There is a very strong out-of-phase correspondence between the time series of chlorophyll variance and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index. We hypothesize that positive PDO conditions, which reflect weak winds and poor upwelling conditions, result in reduced mesoscale variability in the coastal region, and a subsequent decrease in chlorophyll variance. Although the chlorophyll variance responds to basin-scale forcing, chlorophyll biomass does not necessarily correspond to the phase of the PDO, suggesting that it is influenced more by local-scale processes. The mesoscale variability in the system may be as important as the chl a biomass in determining the potential productivity of higher trophic levels.},

	Abstract = {Coccolithophores are important ecological and geochemical components of the global oceans. A global three-dimensional model was used to simulate their distributions in a multi-phytoplankton context. The realism of the simulation was supported by comparisons of model surface nutrients and total chlorophyll with in situ and satellite observations. Nitrate, silica, and dissolved iron surface distributions were positively correlated with in situ data across major oceanographic basins. Global annual departures were + 18.9% for nitrate (model high), + 5.4% for silica, and +45.0% for iron. Total surface chlorophyll was also positively correlated with satellite and in situ data sets across major basins. Global annual departures were -8.0% with Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) (model low), + 1.1 % with Aqua, and -17.1 % with in situ data. Global annual primary production estimates were within 1 % and 9% of estimates derived from SeaWiFS and Aqua, respectively, using a common primary production algorithm. Coccolithophore annual mean relative abundances were 2.6% lower than observations, but were positively correlated across basins. Two of the other three phytoplankton groups, diatoms and cyanobacteria, were also positively correlated with observations. Distributions of coccolithophores were dependent upon interactions and competition with the other phytoplankton groups. In this model, coccolithophores had a competitive advantage over diatoms and chlorophytes by virtue of a greater ability to utilize nutrients and light at low values. However, their higher sinking rates placed them at a disadvantage when nutrients and light were plentiful. In very low nutrient conditions, such as the mid-ocean gyres, coccolithophores were unable to compete with the efficient nutrient utilization capability and low sinking rate of cyanobacteria. Comparisons of simulated coccolithophore distributions with satellite-derived estimates of calcite concentration and coccolithophore blooms showed some agreement, but also areas of departure. Vast blooms observed in the North Atlantic were well-represented by the model. However, model coccolithophores were nearly absent in the North Pacific, while calcite estimates suggested widespread abundance in summer. In situ observations supported the satellite calcite, suggesting a deficiency in the model. New satellite estimates of phytoplankton groups, indicated good agreement of diatoms in one case, and poor agreement in general in another. Comparisons of phytoplankton group primary production with other models showed wide disparity. The divergence among models and satellite estimates is common for such an emerging field of research. The quantitative comparisons with in situ observations are encouraging, but disparities with model and satellite estimates suggested that further research is needed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the retrieval (or inversion) of seawater IOPs from just above water radiance measurements is a multiparameter nonlinear problem that is difficult to solve by conventional optimization methods. The applicability of the simulated annealing algorithm (SA) is explored as a nonlinear global optimizer to solve this multiparameter retrieval problem. The SA algorithm is combined with widely known semianalytical relations for seawater's IOPs to parameter invert these properties from simulated and measured water-leaving reflectance spectra. Furthermore, given the versatility of the SA algorithm, the scheme is extended to retrieve water depth from input reflectance data. Extensive tests and comparisons with in situ and simulated data sets compiled by the International Ocean-Color Coordinating Group are presented. Field data include reflectance spectra acquired with a handheld GER 1500 spectroradiometer and absorption measurements, performed with the AC-9 instrument on waters around Singapore's nearby islands.

	Abstract = {We measured water leaving reflectance, phytoplankton pigments, optical properties and photosynthetic parameters in the southern Benguela ecosystem in October 2002. These data were used to validate MERIS standard products: reflectance (MERIS wavelengths) and Case 1 Chlorophyll- a. In this heterogeneous area, accurate validation required sampling within a few minutes of the satellite overpass. Inter-pigment relationships e. g. Total Chlorophyll (TChla) to Total Pigment (TP) were robust (R-2 similar to 0.99) yet pigment ratios (TChla/TP) were not constant (range 0.44 to 0.62) increasing log-linearly with biomass (R-2 similar to 0.7). Photosynthetic parameters (e. g. Photosynthetic Quantum Efficiency, PQE) and optical ratios (a(676)/a(440)) also increased log-linearly with biomass (R-2 similar to 0.8). PQE, pigment and optical ratios were linearly inter-correlated (R-2 similar to 0.7 to 0.8). From these data we derived the bio-optical traits for several phytoplankton functional types (PFTs): micro-plankton (diatoms and dinoflagellates) had high biomass, pigment ratios and PQE; nano-flagellates had low to intermediate biomass, pigment ratios and PQE; prokaryotes had very low biomass, pigment ratios and PQE. We present MERIS data analysed for PFTs and new products (PQE).},

	Abstract = {Over a range of trophic conditions in the ocean, we argue that variations in productivity are more closely related to variations in phytoplankton absorption than to variations in the cblorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration. Our analysis suggests that environmental variability is expressed through the absorption properties of phytoplankton pigments rather than their quantity, and that productivity normalized to absorption is relatively invariant in the world ocean. The relationship between primary productivity and phytoplankton absorption makes possible a more direct approach to the estimation of ocean productivity from satellite sensors. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{siegel07,
	Abstract = {Sporadic occurrences of milky turquoise waters visible in true colour satellite imagery in the Benguela upwelling system off Namibia are characterized by high reflectances due to enhanced scattering properties. Previous opinion was that the features are due to increased reflectances by elemental sulphur (SO) resulting from upwelling or eruptions of hydrogen sulphide-enriched waters. In March/April 2003, a remotely sensed offshore plume was identified as a coccolithophore bloom for the first time in this region, followed by satellite imagery and intensively investigated using ship-borne measurements. Different methods were applied such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigment analysis, electronic disperse X-ray analysis, scanning electronic microscopy as well as spectral particle absorption and reflectance measurements. Ocean colour satellite data of the SeaWiFS and MERIS sensors were used to investigate the blooms. The SeaWiFS coccolithophore algorithm identified the bloom in March 2003. MERIS-derived spectral reflectances which were in a good agreement with in-situ measurements were used to study the occurrence of blooms in the first half of the year 2004. The observed offshore plumes can be optically divided into two groups. Far offshore the plumes are dominated by coccolithophores Emiliania huxleyi (Type-C) increasing the reflectance by scattering. Directly outside the active upwelling area the spectral shape of reflectance is affected by absorbing phytoplankton, but the magnitude is the result of scattering by coccolithophores and possibly diatom frustules. The coccolithophore bloom water was characterized by high calcite content, the occurrence of the marker pigment 19'-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin as well as by a double maximum in the blue spectral range of the specific absorption of phytoplankton. The coccolithophore bloom develops as a phytoplankton succession during a low wind period in a stable stratified water body with a shallow top layer under high solar radiation with the starting conditions of low silicate and high N/P ratios. In the area off Namibia the sporadic occurrence of milky turquoise water may have two different causes. The features nearshore are due to sulphur discolouration but the further offshore plumes are caused by coccolithoph ores. The occurrence of coccolithophores is not as sporadic as the blooms which are visible in satellite data. These results improve the interpretation of milky turquoise water identified by ocean colour satellite data in the SE Atlantic Ocean off Namibia because they verified the occurrence of coccolithophores in that region for the first time with different methods.

	Abstract = {Surface chlorophyll a concentrations (C-a, mg m(-3)) in the Southern Ocean estimated from SeaWiFS satellite data have been reported in the literature to be significantly lower than those measured from in situ water samples using fluorometric methods. However, we found that high-resolution (similar to 1 km(2)/pixel) daily SeaWiFS C-a (C-a(SWF)) data (SeaDAS4.8, OC4v4 algorithm) was an accurate measure of in situ C-a during January-February of 1998-2002 if concurrent in situ data measured by HPLC (C-a(HPLC)) instead of fluorometric (C-a(Fluor)) measurements were used as ground truth. Our analyses indicate that C-a(Fluor) is 2.48 +/- 2.23 (n = 647) times greater than C-a(HPLC) between 0.05 and 1.5 mg m(-3) and that the percentage overestimation of in situ C, by fluorometric measurements increases with decreasing concentrations. The ratio of C-a(SWF)/C-a(PLC) is 1.12 +/- 0.91 (n = 96), whereas the ratio of C-a(SWF)/Ca-Fluor is 0.55 +/- 0.63 (n = 307). Furthermore, there is no significant bias in C-a(SWF) (12% and -0.07 in linear and log-transformed C-a, respectively) when C-a(HPLC) is used as ground truth instead of C-a(Fluor). The high C-a(Fluor)/C-a(HPLC) ratio may be attributed to the relatively low concentrations of chlorophyll b (C-b/C-a = 0.023 +/- 0.034, n = 482) and relatively high concentrations of chlorophyll c (C-c/C-a = 0.25 +/- 0.59, n = 482) in the phytoplankton pigment composition when compared to values from other regions. Because more than 90% of the waters in the study area, as well as in the entire Southern Ocean (south of 60 degrees S), have C-a(SWF) between 0.05 and 1.5 mg m(-3), we consider that the SeaWiFS performance of C-a retrieval is satisfactory and for this C-a range there is no need to further develop a "regional" bio-optical algorithm to account for the previous SeaWiFS "underestimation".

	Abstract = {The present study examines the potential of using the near-surface chlorophyll a concentration ([Chla](surf)), as it can be derived from ocean color observation, to infer the column-integrated phytoplankton biomass, its vertical distribution, and ultimately the community composition. Within this context, a large High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) pigment database was analyzed. It includes 2419 vertical pigment profiles, sampled in case 1 waters with various trophic states (0.03-6 mg Chla m(-3)). The relationships between [Chla](surf) and the chlorophyll a vertical distribution, as previously derived by Morel and Berthon (1989), are fully confirmed. This agreement makes it possible to go further and to examine if similar relationships between [Chla](surf) and the phytoplankton assemblage composition along the vertical can be derived. Thanks to the detailed pigment composition, and use of specific pigment biomarkers, the contribution to the local chlorophyll a concentration of three phytoplankton groups can be assessed. With some cautions, these groups coincide with three size classes, i.e., microplankton, nanoplankton and picoplankton. Corroborating previous regional findings (e.g., large species dominate in eutrophic environments, whereas tiny phytoplankton prevail in oligotrophic zones), the present results lead to an empirical parameterization applicable to most oceanic waters. The predictive skill of this parameterization is satisfactorily tested on a separate data set. With such a tool, the vertical chlorophyll a profiles of each group can be inferred solely from the knowledge of [Chla](surf). By combining this tool with satellite ocean color data, it becomes possible to quantify on a global scale the phytoplankton biomass associated with each of the three algal assemblages.},

The same mechanisms that were previously invoked to account for the vertical distribution of ecotypes at local scales accounted for the global (horizontal) patterns we observed.

	Abstract = {Within the phytoplankton community, diatoms and dinoflagellates have diverse roles, different spatial patterns and contrasting trophic value: diatoms are the foundation of the copepod-fish food web while dinoflagellates appear less valuable. Changes in relative abundance of these two phytoplankton groups have been linked to pressures such as climate change and eutrophication. Spatially comprehensive data on the seasonal distribution of diatoms and dinoflagellates in non-coastal waters is limited; thus, information concerning their distribution in the open ocean is particularly useful. Here we present spatial and temporal patterns of diatom and dinoflagellate seasonal cycles in the coastal and open NE Atlantic Ocean based on > 100 000 Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) samples. This analysis is presented in the form of monthly composite maps of the spatial distribution of diatoms and dinoflagellates and their relative abundances from 1958 to 2003, whose monthly time scale allows the biogeographical exploration of seasonal cycle patterns for each group. The diatom bloom peaks first during May, with a smaller peak in late summer, while dinoflagellate abundance reaches its peak in August. Spatially, the blooms of both groups begin in the North Sea and spread outward across the NE Atlantic region. Throughout the year, dinoflagellates and diatoms are generally most abundant in the central and southern North Sea, while the minimum abundances of both groups occur to the south of Iceland. These spatially detailed seasonal data are not yet available from remote sensing sources and may be used for the validation of current models and research as well as coastal and resource management.},

	Abstract = {This is the first study on diatom spatial patterns in relation to major oceanographic features along a megascale transect in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean and provides a comparison with diatom distribution in surface sediments. Absolute abundances of diatoms, silicoflagellates and dinoflagellates (> 10-mu m fraction) were assessed in 80 bottle samples from 5 to 50 m, retrieved in November 1993 at 20 stations (30-61 degrees S) along 53 degrees W. Siliceous phytoplankton were scarce in the northern half of the transect and in the south of 57 degrees S (100-150 cells L-1), with a strong peak in the vicinity of the Polar Front (similar to 200 000 cells L-1), whereas dinoflagellates were more abundant at the northern stations (up to 24 000 cells L-1). In the south of 50 degrees S phytoplanktonic cell densities were loosely (but significantly, r = 0.54, P < 0.01) associated with chlorophyll a, whereas in the north of this latitude, this relationship disappeared (r = 0.018, P > 0.1). In total, 191 diatoms and 4 silicoflagellates were recorded. Changes in diatom assemblage compositions along the transect allowed identification of five discrete areas: Subtropical (29 degrees S), Northern Transitional (34-41 degrees S), Southern Transitional (43-48 degrees S), Subantarctic (49-54 degrees S) and Antarctic (55-59 degrees S), each characterized by a set of typical species. Diversity changed little with latitude, but numbers of species were higher in the north of 40 degrees S. Comparison of diatom assemblage makeup in the plankton and in the surface sediments shows very strong disagreements, whereby cold water species are very significantly over-represented in the sedimentary record, suggesting enhanced preservation and strong subsurface equatorward advection of the cold water taxa.},

	Abstract = {Diatoms from 228 Southern Ocean core-top sediment samples were examined to determine the geographic distributions of 32 major diatom species/taxa preserved in the sediments of three zonally-distinct regions; Sea Ice, Open Ocean and the Tropical/Subtropical. In the first of three papers, 14 species/taxa occurring in the region where sea ice covers the ocean surface on an annual basis are geographically documented. Comparisons are drawn between the diatom abundances on the sea floor, sea ice parameters (annual duration and concentration in February and September) and February sea-surface temperature. Such parameters are commonly used in reconstructing past oceanographic conditions in the Sea Ice and Open Ocean zones. Analysis of the geographic patterns and sea-surface parameter correlations reveals species-specific distributions regulated primarily by sea ice coverage and sea-surface temperature, which support the use of diatom remains for the estimation of these past seasurface environmental parameters. Comparison with reliable accounts of the 14 species from the sediments or plankton also provides the first glimpses into species-specific ecology and habitat linkages.

	Abstract = {Recently, a framework has been proposed to monitor plank-ton ecosystems in the North Atlantic and adjacent seas using calanoid copepod species. In this study, we use this framework to investigate, at the community structure (calanoid copepod) level, the long-term changes in plankton ecosystems related to hydro-climatic variability in the North Sea during the period 1958-1999. A chronology of ecological events that occurred in the North Sea is outlined. In addition to the long-term and year-to-year variability, this study reveals that North Sea plankton ecosystems had 2 dynamic regimes during the period 1958-1999: a cold-biological (1962-1982) and a warm-biological dynamic regime (1984-1999). The impact of the regime shift on the community structure of calanoid copepods and total diversity (as mean number of calanoid copepod species per continuous plankton recorder sample) is detectable in the stratified regions of the North Sea after ca. 1983. This study reveals that the regime shift resulted from the conjunction of both local and regional hydro-climatic forcing and a change in the location of an oceanic biogeographical boundary in the north-east Atlantic Ocean, Results indicate a strong dependence of ecological processes in the North Sea to both hydro-climatic and biological variability in the north-east Atlantic Ocean. If the current climate warming persists, results suggest that this may continue to alter the structure of North Sea ecosystems and lead to other regime shifts, thus making it very challenging to predict future responses of North Sea pelagic ecosystems to climate change.},

	Abstract = {A procedure is presented that allows monitoring of the dynamic regime of pelagic ecosystems in the North Atlantic Ocean. It uses a diversity index (mean number of species per continuous plankton recorder [CPR] sample) and species assemblage indicators calculated from all calanoid copepods (108 species) identified by the CPR survey since 1958. In any region of the North Atlantic covered by the CPR survey, the procedure calculates the values of these ecosystem indicators using a constant number of samples, selected randomly, and checks any bias associated with the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the sampling. The procedure is described and illustrated in this study using CPR data in the central North Sea. The usefulness of this tool is demonstrated by a study of the sensitivity of the indicators to the number of CPR samples employed in the estimation of monthly or annual means. Firstly, it is shown that on an annual scale the procedure improves the quality of estimations. However, when long-term changes of a plankton indicator are examined for a particular month, it is crucial to use an appropriate number of CPR samples to detect a significant link between the biological and hydro-climatic environment. Secondly, the importance of using species assemblage indicators is demonstrated. They allowed the detection and the ecological interpretation of both episodic events and the regime shift in the central North Sea. It is shown that the regime shift in the North Sea had a strong impact on plankton community structure and was marked by an increase in diversity related to a progressive increase in warm-water species and a decrease in cold-water species. This study also has important implications for researchers using the CPR data. It demonstrates the robustness of the CPR data, but on the other hand also shows that the spatial and temporal heterogeneity should be assessed with care before interpreting the long-term changes of a CPR-derived plankton indicator.},

	Abstract = {Recently, large-scale changes in the biogeography of calanoid copepod crustaceans have been detected in the northeastern North Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas. Strong biogeographical shifts in all copepod assemblages were found with a northward extension of more than 10degrees in latitude of warm-water species associated with a decrease in the number of colder-water species. These changes were attributed to regional increase in sea surface temperature. Here, we have extended these studies to examine long-term changes in phytoplankton, zooplankton and salmon in relation to hydro-meteorological forcing in the northeast Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas. We found highly significant relationships between (1) long-term changes in all three trophic levels, (2) sea surface temperature in the northeastern Atlantic, (3) Northern Hemisphere temperature and (4) the North Atlantic Oscillation. The similarities detected between plankton, salmon, temperature and hydro-climatic parameters are also seen in their cyclical variability and in a stepwise shift that started after a pronounced increase in Northern Hemisphere Temperature anomalies at the end of the 1970s. All biological variables show a pronounced change which started after circa 1982 for euphausiids (decline), 1984 for the total abundance of small copepods (increase), 1986 for phytoplankton biomass (increase) and Calanus finmarchicus (decrease) and 1988 for salmon (decrease). This cascade of biological events led to an exceptional period, which is identified after 1986 to present and followed another shift in large-scale hydro-climatic variables and sea surface temperature. This regional temperature increase therefore appears to be an important parameter that is at present governing the dynamic equilibrium of northeast Atlantic pelagic ecosystems with possible consequences for biogeochemical processes and fisheries.},

@article{rivkin02,
	Abstract = {The growth and dynamics of plankton in the ocean vary with natural cycles, global climate change and the long-term evolution of ecosystems. The ocean is a large reservoir for CO2 and the food webs in the upper ocean play critical roles in regulating the global carbon cycle, changes in atmospheric CO2 and associated global warming. Microheterotrophs are a key component of the upper ocean food webs. Here, we report on the results of an analysis of the distribution of bacteria and related properties in the World Ocean. We found that, for the data set as a whole, there is a significant latitudinal gradient in all field-measured and computed bacterial properties, except growth rate. Gradients were, for the most part, driven by an equator-ward increase in the Southern Hemisphere. The biomass, rates of production and respiration and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were significantly higher in the Northern than the Southern hemispheres. In contrast, growth rates were the same in the two hemispheres. We conclude that the lower biomass and production in the Southern Hemisphere reflects greater top-down control by microbial grazers, which would be due to a lower abundance or activity of omnivorous zooplankton in the Southern than Northern Hemispheres. These large spatial differences in dynamics, structure and activity of the bacterial community and the microbial food web will be reflected in different patterns of carbon cycling, export and air-sea exchange of CO2 and the potential ability of the ocean to sequester carbon.},

@article{boltovskoy94,
	Abstract = {Sedimentary remains of fossilizable marine organisms, chiefly microplanktonic ones (coccolithophorids, silicoflagellates, diatoms, dinoflagellates, radiolarians, foraminifers) have long been used for biogeographic surveys, usually with the aim of unravelling paleoenvironmental settings. Utilization of bottom deposits (rather than plankton samples) has some advantages for this purpose: thanatocoenoses require smaller sample sizes, materials are more readily available, and they eliminate the small time-scale variability which obscures long-term trends. On the other hand, the sedimentary imprint of planktonic distributional patterns is often severely distorted by fragmentation and dissolution of the biogenic remains, reworking of sediments, winnowing and lateral advection of shells, especially toward lower latitudes, seasonally and interannually variable output rates, and the integration of vertically heterogeneous assemblages. The biases derived from these processes rue reviewed, and the need for more information on selective dissolution, vertical distribution patterns and planktonic reproduction and output rates is stressed. Given the assumptions used in paleoenvironmental studies, distributional information drawn from sediment samples is less prone to yielding biased information when applied to these surveys, than to bio- or paleobiogeographic investigations; albeit the former can also be significantly affected as a result of changes in the traits that govern the formation of biogenic sediments,},

@article{olson94,
	Abstract = {Various combinations of physical and biological models are used to explore factors that determine the distribution of organisms in the world's oceans. The physical models examined include simple box models with parameterized inter-box exchanges that take into account variable box geometries, and specified continuous flows either in the Eulerian frame as stream-functions or as Lagrangian trajectories. A 1-dimensional mixed-layer model and a primitive equation channel model are introduced as examples of dynamical models depicting ocean physics. Biological models are dis cussed starting with a simple nitrogen (N), phytoplankton (P), zooplankton (Z) and detritus (D), NPZD formulation. The equilibria of this model is explored analytically as an example of computing steady state solutions, and then considering where in parameter space extinction occurs. Nonlinearities and expansion of NPZD to multi-species models are also treated. This is followed by the introduction of a nonlinear three-component food chain model, multi-species Lotka-Voltera competition models, and finally a discussion of structured population models including a derivation of a genetics model written in terms of genotypes. The physical models are then coupled with the biological ones in a series of examples. Both the box model with Lotka-Voltera multi-species population dynamics, and the 1-dimensional mixed-layer model with NPZD are used to demonstrate how the existence of spatial and temporal niches can allow a large number of species to coexist within biogeographic domains even though conditions at most sites and times are not conducive to supporting such diversity. These models recreate the basic diversity patterns observed in the pelagic ecosystem at various latitudes. The box model simulations also demonstrate the tendency for diffusive models to overestimate the dispersion of a species. In order to explore the dynamics of the edges of biogeographic domains a three species food chain model is combined with a Lagrangian trajectory calculation that specifies the dynamics of populations in a meandering jet environment. This model shows that the interaction of biological and physical dynamics can produce complex species distribution patterns that would be difficult to interpret from field observations of species abundance alone. Finally, results from a population genetics box model show that even when there is significant exchange of organisms between domains and natural selection affects allele and genotype proportions, genotype frequencies are in approximate Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. This demonstrates the overly restrictive nature of some of the Hardy-Weinberg assumptions and provides a means for exploring population dynamics in a biogeographic context.},

@article{krause94,
	Abstract = {Pelagic biogeography deals with the large scale distributional patterns of pelagic organisms in the world's oceans, their origins through evolution and the changes in ocean morphology during the geological past, and the factors which currently control and maintain them. The knowledge it generates has a wide variety of uses in science, both basic and applied, and in socio-economics. Its products include: (1) Distributional data compiled in data bases, maps and atlases; (2) Explanatory scientific and non-scientific publications on the distributions and their implications; (3) Standardisation of methodologies; (4) Trained specialists; (5) Advice to society on oceanic aspects of global resource management; and (6) Assessments of oceanic biodiversity in relation to the Biodiversity Convention. The immediate users of this knowledge include oceanographers in other disciplines, ecologists, applied scientists and engineers, resource managers, fishermen, environmentalists, teachers, international lawyers and policy-makers. At present the largest users are the natural resource managers seeking to optimise and to sustain the resource for which they are responsible. There is a considerable body of national and international legislation which is underpinned by biogeographical information. Similarly much of our understanding about past climate which is being used to predict future trends, is based on applying information on present-day distributional patterns to the interpretation of the fossil record in marine sediments. Global change, in the ocean, the atmosphere and on land, is strongly modulated by the feedback between marine organisms, nutrients and greenhouse gases, The marked coherence observed between the distributions of physical, chemical and biological patterns suggest that the processes involved in this feedback are linked with pelagic community structure. Remote sensing of sea-surface properties and the heat content of the mixed-layer, offer considerable potential for linking ecological and biogeographical processes to large scale features of ocean circulation and climatology. The long-term monitoring of the ocean in the Global Ocean Observing System will need to integrate physical, chemical and ecological data, if the models used to predict future change are to achieve adequate precision. The future use and resource management of the oceans has to involve biogeographical information. Traditional sampling methods, even when supplemented by large scale surveys such as CALCOFI and the Continuous Plankton Recorder surveys,will never provide sufficient data, so new techniques for intensive sampling and monitoring are being sought. Some surrogate measures such as chlorophyll fluorescence are already well established as standard oceanographic methodology; others involving acoustics and optical properties have the potential for sampling the biological characteristics at the same time/space scales as the physicochemical properties of the oceans are being studied. However, the calibration of these new techniques against traditional sampling and observational methods remains problematic. Information technology is beginning to be used, not only to unify the systematics of many taxonomic groups, but also to improve information exchange. Improvements in digital data bases will lead to freer exchange of information, and also facilitate the production of maps and interpretations customized for other users. The scientific resources being devoted to pelagic biogeography are declining with potentially serious consequences. This trend can only be reversed if the biogeographers themselves make their output more accessible and user-friendly for non-scientists, and take advantage of the new technologies which promise to re-vitalise the field.},

	Abstract = {The need for predictive process-oriented planktonic ecosystem models is widely recognized by the aquatic science community. We conducted a meta-analysis of recent mechanistic aquatic biogeochemical models (153 studies published from 1990 to 2002), to assess their ability to predict spatial and temporal patterns in the physical, chemical and biological dynamics of planktonic systems. The selected modeling studies covered a wide range of model complexity, ecosystem-types, spatio-temporal scales and purposes for model development. Despite the heterogeneous nature of this data set, we were able to identify model behavior trends and illuminate aspects of current modeling practice that need to be reevaluated. Temperature and dissolved oxygen had the highest coefficients of determination (respective median r(2) values were 0.93 and 0.70) and the lowest relative error (median RE < 10%), nutrients and phytoplankton had intermediate predictability (median r(2) values ranging from 0.40 to 0.60 and median RE similar to 40 %), whereas bacteria (median r(2) = 0.06) and zoo-plankton (median RE = 70 %) dynamics were poorly predicted. Longer simulation periods (i.e. months to decades) reduced model predictability, and increased model complexity did not improve fit. Aquatic biogeochemical modelers need to be more consistent in how they apply conventional methodological steps during model development (i.e. sensitivity analysis, validation), and the aquatic modeling community should adopt generally accepted standards of model performance. Recent advancements in data assimilation techniques, the combination of the present family of models with goal functions (derived from non-equilibrium thermodynamics) and the development of models with a stronger physiological basis are promising frameworks for obtaining more accurate simulations of planktonic processes.},

@article{soetaert07,
	Abstract = {The impact of biogeochemical and physical processes on aquatic chemistry is usually expressed in terms of alkalinity. Here we show how to directly calculate the effect of single processes on pH. Under the assumptions of equilibrium and electroneutrality, the rate of change of pH can be calculated as the product of (1) the net charge exchanged during the process and (2) the consequent buffering of pH variations. As both the chemical buffering and the charge of reactive species changes with pH, so does the effect of biogeochemical processes depend on pH. We calculate the effect on pH for a variety of biogeochemical processes, typical for both the water column and sediments, and for a pH range of 2-12. Four different response patterns emerge. (1) Some processes, e.g. nitrate assimilation, iron and manganese reduction, and calcite dissolution monotonically tend towards higher pH. (2) Other processes, e.g. calcification and most oxidation reactions monotonically lower the pH. (3) Most respiration reactions and the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) converge to a pH between 5.2 (aerobic respiration) and 7.9 (AOM). (4) Ammonium assimilation and the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX) either tend to very low or very high pH, depending on initial conditions, i.e. pH diverges away from an unstable neutral point, at pH 5.2 and 7.1 respectively. Similar response patterns are observed when the effects of combinations of processes are considered. We discuss two general applications of our approach. (1) Biogenic calcification (C) coupled to photosynthetic production (P) is a type 4 process, with pH diverging from an unstable neutral point. (2) On the long-term, the AOM converges pH to values that are high enough to enable calcification. This contrasts to sulphate reduction, where the equilibrium pH is too low for calcification. This explains the strong linkage between AOM and carbonate formation, whilst sulphate reduction, unless it is followed by sulphide precipitation does generally not lead to calcification. The method is not intended to replace complex transport-reaction modelling where accurate prediction of the pH is desired.},

	Abstract = {The move to ecosystem-based management of marine fisheries and endangered species would be greatly facilitated by a quantitative method for identifying marine ecosystems that captures temporal dynamics at meso-scale (10s or 100s of kilometers) resolutions. Understanding the dynamics of ecosystem boundaries, which may differ according to the species of interest or the management objectives, is a fundamental challenge of ecosystem-based management. We present an adaptive ecosystem classification that begins to address these challenges. To demonstrate the approach, we quantitatively bounded distinct, biologically meaningful marine regions in the North Pacific Ocean based on physical oceanography. We identified the regions by applying image classification algorithms to a comprehensive description of the ocean's surface, derived from an oceanographic circulation model. Our resulting maps illustrate 15 distinct marine regions. The size and location of these regions related well to previously described water masses in the North Pacific. We investigated seasonal and long-term changes in the pattern of regions and their boundaries by dividing the oceanographic data into four seasons and two 10-year time periods, one on either side of the 1976-1977 North Pacific Ocean climate regime shift. We compared our results for each season across the regime shift and for sequential seasons within regimes using the Kappa Index of Agreement and the index of Average Mutual Information. Seasonal patterns were more similar between regimes than from one season to the next within a regime, while the magnitude of seasonal transitions appeared to differ before and after the regime shift. We assessed the biological relevance of the identified regions using seasonal maps derived from remotely sensed chlorophyll-a concentrations ({$[$}chl-a{$]$}). We used Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank sum tests to evaluate the correspondence between the {$[$}chl-a{$]$} maps and our post-regime shift regions. There was a significant difference in {$[$}chl-a{$]$} among the regions in all seasons. We found that the number of regions with distinct chlorophyll signatures, and the associations between different regions, varied by season. The overall pattern of association between the regions was suggestive of observed, broad-scale patterns in the seasonal development and distribution of primary production in the North Pacific. This demonstrated that regions with different biological properties can be delineated using only physical variables. The flexibility of our approach will enable researchers to visualize the geographic extents of regions with similar physical conditions, providing insight into ocean dynamics and changes in marine ecosystems. It will also provide resource managers with a powerful tool for broad application in ecosystem-based management and conservation of marine resources.},

	Abstract = {An upper-ocean vortex associated with tropical instabilities was observed during fall 1990 at 140{${}^\circ$}W in the shear region between the Pacific South Equatorial Current and the North Equatorial Counter current. The velocity and thermohaline structures of the vortex were mapped in three dimensions using hydrography, acoustic Doppler current measurements, drifters, and satellite infrared images. The vortex translated westward at 30 cm s\&{\#}8722;1 (0.24{${}^\circ$} day\&{\#}8722;1), stationary relative to the mean flow, and less than half the 80 cm s\&{\#}8722;1 speed of contemporaneous meridional oscillations of the Equatorial Undercurrent and South Equatorial Current. The coherent flow pattern was restricted to above the thermocline. Convergence at the North Equatorial Front and divergence near the vortex center occurred in a dipole pattern similar to those predicted by various numerical models. The convergence and the anticyclonic vorticity were of the same magnitudes as the local inertial frequency, suggesting that the feature was a fully nonlinear, large Rossby number vortex, and may have been subject to centrifugal instability. The anticyclonic flow was associated with a thermocline depression of 30 m and a deformation of the North Equatorial Front. Northward advection of cold, saline, equatorial water and southward advection of warmer, fresher, tropical water yielded the cusplike surface temperature pattern commonly associated with tropical instabilities. Equatorward heat and freshwater fluxes implied cooling and freshening from 3{${}^\circ$}N to 5{${}^\circ$}N, comparable to the annual-mean net surface heating and evaporation minus precipitation for the region. },

	Abstract = {A weekly 1&#176; spatial resolution optimum interpolation (OI) sea surface temperature (SST) analysis has been produced at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) using both in situ and satellite data from November 1981 to the present. The weekly product has been available since 1993 and is widely used for weather and climate monitoring and forecasting. Errors in the satellite bias correction and the sea ice to SST conversion algorithm are discussed, and then an improved version of the OI analysis is developed. The changes result in a modest reduction in the satellite bias that leaves small global residual biases of roughly &#8722;0.03&#176;C. The major improvement in the analysis occurs at high latitudes due to the new sea ice algorithm where local differences between the old and new analysis can exceed 1&#176;C. Comparisons with other SST products are needed to determine the consistency of the OI. These comparisons show that the differences among products occur on large time- and space scales with monthly rms differences exceeding 0.5&#176;C in some regions. These regions are primarily the mid- and high-latitude Southern Oceans and the Arctic where data are sparse, as well as high-gradient areas such as the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio where the gradients cannot be properly resolved on a 1&#176; grid. In addition, globally averaged differences of roughly 0.05&#176;C occur among the products on decadal scales. These differences primarily arise from the same regions where the rms differences are large. However, smaller unexplained differences also occur in other regions of the midlatitude Northern Hemisphere where in situ data should be adequate.

	Abstract = {Fish were collected from the intake screens of the Oldbury Power Station in the Severn Estuary in each week between early July 1972 and late June 1977 and at least twice monthly between early January 1996 and late June 1999. The annual catches, after adjustment to a common sampling effort, demonstrate that the abundance of fish at Oldbury was far greater in the 1990s than 1970s, mainly due to marked increases in the numbers of certain marine species, such as sand goby, whiting, bass, thin-lipped grey mullet, herring, sprat and Norway pout. These increases may reflect the great improvement that occurred in the water quality of the Severn Estuary between these decades. The only species that declined markedly in abundance was poor cod. Modest declines in flounder and River lamprey paralleled those occurring elsewhere in the UK. The species composition in the two decades also differed, reflecting changes not only in the relative abundances of the various marine estuarine-opportunistic species, which dominated the ichthyofauna, but also in those of the suite of less abundant species in the estuary. The cyclical changes undergone each year by the species composition of the fish fauna of the Severn Estuary reflect sequential intra-annual changes in the relative abundances of species representing each of the marine, diadromous and freshwater categories. New approaches have been developed to test whether or not large sets of correlations between patterns of recruitment amongst abundant marine species (internal correlations), and between those patterns and salinity and water temperature within the estuary (cross-correlations), were significant. The correlation profile analyses found no evidence that the annual recruitment strengths of these species were either intercorrelated, or correlated with either one or a combination of both of the above environmental variables. Yet, the timings of the recruitment of these species into the estuary were intercorrelated, i.e. a slightly earlier or later than normal immigration by one species in a given year was paralleled by the same trend in other species. However, this association in recruitment times could be linked neither to salinity nor water temperature within the estuary, nor to a combination of these two variables. These results indicate that, while the factors that influence the annual recruitment strengths of the juveniles of different marine species vary, inter-annual differences in the phasing of events that regulate spawning times and/or larval dispersal influence, in the same direction, the times when marine species are recruited into the estuary.},

	Abstract = {Adsorption of NH4+ was measured for 15 North Sea sediments having different contents of organic matter and fine particles. Based on a previous study, the stations were grouped in three clusters: I, silty sediments; II, fine sands; and III, medium sands. The sediments span the range of erosive to depositional areas along the main transport route of particulate matter in the North Sea. Contents of organic carbon and fine particles (<6 {$[$}mu{$]$}m), both providing potential sorption sites for the NH4+, followed this clustering with highest values in silty sediments and lowest in medium sand. Vertical profiles in the sediment of easily exchangeable NH4+ (EEA, extracted with 2m KCI in 2 h) showed lower contents in winter than in summer, with maximum values in the silty sediments (up to 2500 nmol g-1), and lowest in medium sand (<40 nmol g-1), Dimensionless distribution coefficients (ratio EEA:NH4+ dissolved in the pore water, corrected for porosity) were very high (> 100) in the upper 10 mm of some sediments, but were between 1 and 7 below 40 mm depth at all stations. Sorption isotherms were non-linear with steep slopes at NH4+ <40 {$[$}mu{$]$}mol dm-3. Dimensionless sorption coefficients obtained from the slope of the isotherms were between 0.1 and 12.3 at NH4+, = 1 {$[$}mu{$]$}mol dm-3, with large variation between stations. At NH4+ = 100 {$[$}mu{$]$}mol dm-3, sorption coefficients were less variable between 0.2 and 0.9. The data suggest that the high coefficients at low concentrations are caused by sorption onto organic matter, which in turn is associated with clays and silt. Adsorption of NH4+, depends non-linearly on the concentration in the pore water, and the application of constant distribution coefficients to model NH4+, sorption can be a serious over-simplification of reality.},

	Abstract = {We present a simplified method for solving the local equilibrium carbonate chemistry in numerical ocean biogeochemistry models. Compared to the methods typically used, the scheme is fast, efficient and compact. The accuracy of the solution is dictated by the number of species retained in the expression for alkalinity and there is almost no computational penalty for retaining minor contributions. We demonstrate that this scheme accurately reproduces the results of the commonly used method in the context of a three-dimensional global ocean carbon cycle model. Using this model we also show that neglecting the regional variations in surface dissolved inorganic phosphorus and silicic acid concentrations can lead to significant systematic bias in regional estimates of air-sea carbon fluxes using such models.

	Abstract = {During the last glacial period, Earth's climate underwent frequent large and abrupt global changes. This behavior appears to reflect the ability of the ocean's thermohaline circulation to assume more than one mode of operation. The record in ancient sedimentary rocks suggests that similar abrupt changes plagued the Earth at other times. The trigger mechanism for these reorganizations may have been the antiphasing of polar insolation associated with orbital cycles. Were the ongoing increase in atmospheric CO2 levels to trigger another such reorganization, it would be bad news for a world striving to feed 11 to 16 billion people.},

One attributes such changes to reorganizations of the ocean's thermohaline circulation and the other to changes in tropical atmosphere-ocean dynamics. In an attempt to distinguish between these hypotheses, two lines of evidence are examined. The first involves the timing of the freshwater injections to the northern Atlantic that have been suggested as triggers for the global impacts associated with the Younger Dryas and Heinrich events. The second has to do with evidence for precursory events associated with the Heinrich ice-rafted debris layers in the northern Atlantic and with the abrupt Dansgaard-Oeschger warmings recorded in the Santa Barbara Basin.},

No consistent lead-lag relationships are observed during abrupt millennial warming events during the last ice age, allowing for the possibility that ocean circulation triggered some millenial climate changes. At the major glacial-interglacial transitions, the global carbon budget and thermohaline ocean circulation responded sequentially to the climate changes that forced the growth and decline of continental ice sheets.},

But it remains difficult to assess the likelihood of future changes in the thermohaline circulation, mainly owing to poorly constrained model parameterizations and uncertainties in the response of the climate system to greenhouse warming. Analyses of past abrupt climate changes help to solve these problems. Data and models both suggest that abrupt climate change during the last glaciation originated through changes in the Atlantic thermohaline circulation in response to small changes in the hydrological cycle. Atmospheric and oceanic responses to these changes were then transmitted globally through a number of feedbacks. The palaeoclimate data and the model results also indicate that the stability of the thermohaline circulation depends on the mean climate state.},

Projected increases in carbon dioxide and temperature over the next 50 years exceed the conditions under which coral reefs have flourished over the past half-million years. However, reefs will change rather than disappear entirely, with some species already showing far greater tolerance to climate change and coral bleaching than others. International integration of management strategies that support reef resilience need to be vigorously implemented, and complemented by strong policy decisions to reduce the rate of global warming.},

	Abstract = {Degradation of marine organic carbon provides a major source of atmospheric carbon dioxide, whereas preservation in sediments results in accumulation of oxygen. These processes involve the slow decay of chemically recalcitrant compounds and physical protection. To assess the importance of physical protection, we constructed a reaction-diffusion model in which organic matter differs only in its accessibility to microbial degradation but not its intrinsic reactivity. The model predicts that organic matter decays logarithmically with time t and that decay rates decrease approximately as 0.2 x t-1 until burial. Analyses of sediment-core data are consistent with these predictions. },

	Abstract = {Marine aerosol contributes significantly to the global aerosol load and consequently has an important impact on both the Earth's albedo and climate. So far, much of the focus on marine aerosol has centred on the production of aerosol from sea-salt and non-sea-salt sulphates. Recent field experiments, however, have shown that known aerosol production processes for inorganic species cannot account for the entire aerosol mass that occurs in submicrometre sizes. Several experimental studies have pointed to the presence of significant concentrations of organic matter in marine aerosol. There is some information available about the composition of organic matter, but the contribution of organic matter to marine aerosol, as a function of aerosol size, as well as its characterization as hydrophilic or hydrophobic, has been lacking. Here we measure the physical and chemical characteristics of submicrometre marine aerosol over the North Atlantic Ocean during plankton blooms progressing from spring through to autumn. We find that during bloom periods, the organic fraction dominates and contributes 63% to the submicrometre aerosol mass (about 45% is water-insoluble and about 18% water-soluble). In winter, when biological activity is at its lowest, the organic fraction decreases to 15%.

	Abstract = {Reorganizations of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation were associated with large and abrupt climatic changes in the North Atlantic region during the last glacial period. Projections with climate models suggest that similar reorganizations may also occur in response to anthropogenic global warming. Here I use ensemble simulations with a coupled climate-ecosystem model of intermediate complexity to investigate the possible consequences of such disturbances to the marine ecosystem. In the simulations, a disruption of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation leads to a collapse of the North Atlantic plankton stocks to less than half of their initial biomass, owing to rapid shoaling of winter mixed layers and their associated separation from the deep ocean nutrient reservoir. Globally integrated export production declines by more than 20 per cent owing to reduced upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water and gradual depletion of upper ocean nutrient concentrations. These model results are consistent with the available high-resolution palaeorecord, and suggest that global ocean productivity is sensitive to changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.},

	Abstract = {The prospect of rapid dynamic changes in the environment is a pressing concern that has profound management and public policy implications. Worries over sudden climate change and irreversible changes in ecosystems are rooted in the potential that nonlinear systems have for complex and 'pathological' behaviours. Nonlinear behaviours have been shown in model systems and in some natural systems, but their occurrence in large-scale marine environments remains controversial. Here we show that time series observations of key physical variables for the North Pacific Ocean that seem to show these behaviours are not deterministically nonlinear, and are best described as linear stochastic. In contrast, we find that time series for biological variables having similar properties exhibit a low-dimensional nonlinear signature. To our knowledge, this is the first direct test for nonlinearity in large-scale physical and biological data for the marine environment. These results address a continuing debate over the origin of rapid shifts in certain key marine observations as coming from essentially stochastic processes or from dominant nonlinear mechanisms. Our measurements suggest that large-scale marine ecosystems are dynamically nonlinear, and as such have the capacity for dramatic change in response to stochastic fluctuations in basin-scale physical states.},

	Abstract = {Deep chlorophyll maxima (DCMs) are widespread in large parts of the world's oceans. These deep layers of high chlorophyll concentration reflect a compromise of phytoplankton growth exposed to two opposing resource gradients: light supplied from above and nutrients supplied from below. It is often argued that DCMs are stable features. Here we show, however, that reduced vertical mixing can generate oscillations and chaos in phytoplankton biomass and species composition of DCMs. These fluctuations are caused by a difference in the timescales of two processes: (1) rapid export of sinking plankton, withdrawing nutrients from the euphotic zone and (2) a slow upward flux of nutrients fuelling new phytoplankton production. Climate models predict that global warming will reduce vertical mixing in the oceans. Our model indicates that reduced mixing will generate more variability in DCMs, thereby enhancing variability in oceanic primary production and in carbon export into the ocean interior.},

	Abstract = {We examined the factors that determine the citations of 153 mechanistic aquatic biogeochemical modeling papers published from 1990 to 2002. Our analysis provides overwhelming evidence that ocean modeling is a dynamic area of the current modeling practice. Models developed to gain insight into the ocean carbon cycle/marine biogeochemistry are most highly cited, the produced knowledge is exported to other cognitive disciplines, and oceanic modelers are less reluctant to embrace technical advances (e.g., assimilation schemes) and more critically increase model complexity. Contrary to our predictions, model application for environmental management issues on a local scale seems to have languished; the pertinent papers comprise a smaller portion of the published modeling literature and receive lower citations. Given the critical planning information that these models aim to provide, we hypothesize that the latter finding probably stems from conceptual weaknesses, methodological omissions, and an evident lack of haste from modelers to adopt new ideas in their repertoire when addressing environmental management issues. We also highlight the lack of significant association between citation frequency and model complexity, model performance, implementation of conventional methodological steps during model development (e.g., validation, sensitivity analysis), number of authors, and country of affiliation. While these results cast doubt on the rationale of the current modeling practice, the fact that the Fasham et al. (1990) paper has received over 400 citations probably dictates what should be done from the modeling community to meet the practical need for attractive and powerful modeling tools.},

	Abstract = {Nitrogen fixation is crucial for maintaining biological productivity in the oceans, because it replaces the biologically available nitrogen that is lost through denitrification. But, owing to its temporal and spatial variability, the global distribution of marine nitrogen fixation is difficult to determine from direct shipboard measurements. This uncertainty limits our understanding of the factors that influence nitrogen fixation, which may include iron, nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios, and physical conditions such as temperature. Here we determine nitrogen fixation rates in the world's oceans through their impact on nitrate and phosphate concentrations in surface waters, using an ocean circulation model. Our results indicate that nitrogen fixation rates are highest in the Pacific Ocean, where water column denitrification rates are high but the rate of atmospheric iron deposition is low. We conclude that oceanic nitrogen fixation is closely tied to the generation of nitrogen-deficient waters in denitrification zones, supporting the view that nitrogen fixation stabilizes the oceanic inventory of fixed nitrogen over time.},

	Abstract = {Modelling studies of upper ocean phenomena, such as that of the spatial and temporal patchiness in plankton distributions, typically employ coupled biophysical models, with biology in each grid-cell represented by a plankton ecosystem model. It has not generally been considered what impact the choice of grid-cell ecosystem model, from the many developed in the literature, might have upon the results of such a study. We use the methods of synchronisation theory, which is concerned with ensembles of interacting oscillators, to address this question, considering the simplest possible case of a chain of identically represented interacting plankton grid-cells. It is shown that the ability of the system to exhibit stably homogeneous (fully synchronised) dynamics depends crucially upon the choice of biological model and number of grid-cells, with dynamics changing dramatically at a threshold strength of mixing between grid-cells. Consequently, for modelling studies of the ocean the resolution chosen, and therefore number of grid-cells used, could drastically alter the emergent features of the model. It is shown that chaotic ecosystem dynamics, in particular, should be used with care.},

The modeled organisms included types analogous to the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus.

This flexible representation of community structure can be used to explore relations between ecosystems, biogeochemical cycles, and climate change.},

	Abstract = {Abrupt changes in climate, termed Dansgaard-Oeschger and Heinrich events, have punctuated the last glacial period (approximately 100-10 kyr ago) but not the Holocene (the past 10 kyr). Here we use an intermediate-complexity climate model to investigate the stability of glacial climate, and we find that only one mode of Atlantic Ocean circulation is stable: a cold mode with deep water formation in the Atlantic Ocean south of Iceland. However, a 'warm' circulation mode similar to the present-day Atlantic Ocean is only marginally unstable, and temporary transitions to this warm mode can easily be triggered. This leads to abrupt warm events in the model which share many characteristics of the observed Dansgaard-Oeschger events. For a large freshwater input (such as a large release of icebergs), the model's deep water formation is temporarily switched off, causing no strong cooling in Greenland but warming in Antarctica, as is observed for Heinrich events. Our stability analysis provides an explanation why glacial climate is much more variable than Holocene climate.},

Ocean circulation is thus an active and highly nonlinear player in the global climate game. Increasingly clear evidence implicates ocean circulation in abrupt and dramatic climate shifts, such as sudden temperature changes in Greenland on the order of 5-10 degrees C and massive surges of icebergs into the North Atlantic Ocean --events that have occurred repeatedly during the last glacial cycle.},

Instead, we show that chlorophyll maxima are located in abnormally warm water, in Rossby wave-induced convergences. This excludes inputs of nutrients from deeper water. We argue that the sea color anomalies are not caused by chlorophyll but by floating particles evolved from the ecosystem and accumulated by Rossby waves, acting as "marine hay rakes," in convergence zones. Such processes may be determinant for the distribution of living organisms in oligotrophic areas.},

	Abstract = {A modelling system for coupled physical--biogeochemical simulations in the water column is presented here. The physical model component allows for a number of different statistical turbulence closure schemes, ranging from simple algebraic closures to two-equation turbulence models with algebraic second-moment closures. The biogeochemical module consists of models which are based on a number of state variables represented by their ensemble averaged concentrations. Specific biogeochemical models may range from simple NPZ (nutrient--phytoplankton--zooplankton) to complex ecosystem models. Recently developed modified Patankar solvers for ordinary differential equations allow for stable discretisations of the production and destruction terms guaranteeing conservative and non-negative solutions. The increased stability of these new solvers over explicit solvers is demonstrated for a plankton spring bloom simulation. The model system is applied to marine ecosystem dynamics the Northern North Sea and the Central Gotland Sea. Two different biogeochemical models are applied, a conservative nitrogen-based model to the North Sea, and a more complex model including an oxygen equation to the Baltic Sea, allowing for the reproduction of chemical processes under anoxic conditions. For both applications, earlier model results obtained with slightly different model setups could be basically reproduced. It became however clear that the choice for ecosystem model parameters such as maximum phytoplankton growth rates does strongly depend on the physical model parameters (such as turbulence closure models or external forcing).},

	Abstract = {Abstract In this paper, we apply recently developed positivity preserving and conservative Modified Patankar-type solvers for ordinary differential equations to a simple stiff biogeochemical model for the water column. The performance of this scheme is compared to schemes which are not unconditionally positivity preserving (the first-order Euler and the second- and fourth-order RungeKutta schemes) and to schemes which are not conservative (the first- and second-order Patankar schemes). The biogeochemical model chosen as a test ground is a standard nutrientphytoplanktonzooplanktondetritus (NPZD) model, which has been made stiff by substantially decreasing the half saturation concentration for nutrients. For evaluating the stiffness of the biogeochemical model, so-called numerical time scales are defined which are obtained empirically by applying high-resolution numerical schemes. For all ODE solvers under investigation, the temporal error is analysed for a simple exponential decay law. The performance of all schemes is compared to a high-resolution high-order reference solution. As a result, the second-order modified PatankarRungeKutta scheme gives a good agreement with the reference solution even for time steps 10 times longer than the shortest numerical time scale of the problem. Other schemes do either compute negative values for non-negative state variables (fully explicit schemes), violate conservation (the Patankar schemes) or show low accuracy (all first-order schemes).},

@article{babin96,
	Abstract = {Natural variability of the maximum quantum yield of carbon fixation (?C max), as determined from the initial slope of the photosynthesis-irradiance curve and from light absorption measurements, was studied at three sites in the northeast tropical Atlantic representing typical eutrophic, mesotrophic and oligotrophic regimes. At the eutrophic and mesotrophic sites, where the mixed layer extended deeper than the euphotic layer, all photosynthetic parameters were nearly constant with depth, and ?C max averaged between 0.05 and 0.03 mol C (mol quanta absorbed)?1, respectively. At the oligotrophic site, a deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) existed and ?C max varied from ca 0.005 in the upper nutrient-depleted mixed layer to 0.063 below the DCM in stratified waters. Firstly, ?C max was found roughly to covary with nitrate concentration between sites and with depth at the oligotrophic site, and secondly, it was found to decrease with increasing relative concentrations of non-photosynthetic pigments. The extent of ?C max variations directly related to nitrate concentration was inferred from variations in the fraction of functional PS2 reaction centers (f), measured using fast repetition rate fluorometry. Covariations between f and nitrate concentration indicate that the latter factor may be responsible for a 2-fold variation in ?C max. Moreover, partitioning light absorption between photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic pigments suggests that the variable contribution of the non-photosynthetic absorption may explain a 3-fold variation in ?C max, as indicated by variations in the effective absorption cross-section of photosystem 2 (?PS2). Results confirm the role of nitrate in ?C max variation, and emphasize those of light and vertical mixing. },

	Abstract = {It is now widely accepted that global warming is occurring, yet its effects on the world's largest ecosystem, the marine pelagic realm, are largely unknown. We show that sea surface warming in the Northeast Atlantic is accompanied by increasing phytoplankton abundance in cooler regions and decreasing phytoplankton abundance in warmer regions. This impact propagates up the food web (bottom-up control) through copepod herbivores to zooplankton carnivores because of tight trophic coupling. Future warming is therefore likely to alter the spatial distribution of primary and secondary pelagic production, affecting ecosystem services and placing additional stress on already-depleted fish and mammal populations. },
