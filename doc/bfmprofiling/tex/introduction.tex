This report will use different profiling tools to analyze the performance of the Biochemical Flux Model ({\it BFM})\cite{bfm_2014} in standalone and coupled mode. 

The objective of this report is to detect parts of the code susceptibles of improvement. Executing different tests (see Chapter \ref{chap:tests}) and using a serie of 
common profiling tools (see Section \ref{subsec:soft_tools}), performance will be evaluated  measurements of memory usage and/or execution time.

BFM source code can be downloaded freely from the BFM website: \url{http://www.bfm-community.eu}.
