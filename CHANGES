SYSTEM v3.0
This is the first release that relax the separation betweeen the system and the
BFM model code. There will be one sigle number for the whole code structure.
This release has several changes:
BFM:
-----
- General: 
  Improved Makefile: automatically-generated files are now removed from 
  standard directories, and created after the first compilation. 
  Added 2 new arrays for treating the boundary conditions 
  with the atmosphere and the sediments
  PELSURFACE(NO_BOX_STATES,NO_BOXES_XY),PELBOTTOM (NO_BOX_STATES,NO_BOXES_XY)
  This change allows to store all boundary fluxes and to have a boundary
  condition for each state variable.
  Added a new general parameter for the computation of Light value in a cell
  LightLocation (1=top, 2=middle, 3=average)
- Phytoplankton: restored the original ERSEM formulation for nutrient-limited 
  growth (nutrient-stress carbon release). 
  It is now possible to have 2 different parameterizations:
  1) ERSEM II: also described in Vichi et al. (2007a) 
  2) Net growth parameterization (Phyto.nml parameter p_netgrowth=.TRUE.)
     based on Ruardij et al. (2006) and Vichi et al. (2004)
- Bacteria: added the possibility to have 2 degradation rates for DOM,
  p_sulR1, p_suhR1.
  Default values are equal for both DOM quality (for compatibility)
- Zooplankton: possibility to have fixed nutrient quota in micro e meso.
  When using fixed nutrient quota, these state variables are not transported
  with a considerable saving of computational time in 3D applications.
- Benthic Model: improved initialization of benthic model.
  The flag calc_init_bennut_states=1 in bfm.nml (Standalone) or bio_bfm.nml
  (GOTM) set the initial values of the benthic system in equilibrium
  with the initial pelagic concentration.
  There is now a different burial rate for DOM, R6 and Pi at the sediment-
  water interface (Settling.nml).
  The layer shifting dynamics is now modified with an improved flux-limiter.
Configurations:
----------------
IMPORTANT: fixed a bug in array-valued parameters. This involves predator-
  prey availability factors that where read in a wrong way.
  Please update all your namelist files. 
- Standalone: corrected a bug with irradiance units. The conversion in uE was
  not done.
- GOTM: the coupling with GOTM is supported in a hybrid way. BFM is not
  an internal component of GOTM-BIO but uses exactly the same routines and 
  solver schemes.
  The GOTM source directory needs to be patched with a file provided in 
  the BFM-gotm directory. The compilation is done in GOTM by activating 
  the -DBFM macro.
  It is also possible to use a temporary option for external boundary 
  fluxes. This function will be improved in the near future.
- NEMO: first coupling implementation with NEMO. Tested only in 1D configuration

-------
note to developers: this release takes into account all the changes logged 
  in the branches/mav/bfm-nemo branch. All the changes have been merged and
  the branch is closed now.

SYSTEM v2.1
- activating the BFM_GOTM key now allows the use of the other bio models in gotm
  (modified bio_save.F90)
SYSTEM v2.0
- added the GOTM interface
- changed the name of the BFM rootdir env variable from ROOTDIR to BFMDIR
STANDALONE v1.3
- Added bottom deposition and oxygenation fluxes (standalone.F90: envforcing_bfm)
  STANDALONE now runs with bio_setup=2 (benthic-only setup)
- new namelist in standalone.nml collecting all the parameters of the analytical
  forcings
STANDALONE v1.2
- Added the initialisation for chl in phytoplankton via namelist. 
  Needed for running with ChlLighFlag=1 (bio_bfm.F90)
- Added the zeroing of state variables when switched off (bio_bfm.f90). 
  Connected to the change below.
- Variables and systems are switched off according to bio_setup (bio_bfm.F90)
- Removed the control on variable storage dependent on the bio_setup choice. 
  This allows to save pelagic variables even if the benthic-only system is run (netcdf_bfm.F90)
