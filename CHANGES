STANDALONE v1.2
- Added the initialisation for chl in phytoplankton via namelist. 
  Needed for running with ChlLighFlag=1 (bio_bfm.F90)
- Added the zeroing of state variables when switched off (bio_bfm.f90). 
  Connected to the change below.
- Variables and systems are switched off according to bio_setup (bio_bfm.F90)
- Removed the control on variable storage dependent on the bio_setup choice. 
  This allows to save pelagic variables even if the benthic-only system is run (netcdf_bfm.F90)
STANDALONE v1.3
- Added bottom deposition and oxygenation fluxes (standalone.F90: envforcing_bfm)
  STANDALONE now runs with bio_setup=2 (benthic-only setup)
- new namelist in standalone.nml collecting all the parameters of the analytical
  forcings
SYSTEM v2.0
- added the GOTM interface
- changed the name of the BFM rootdir env variable from ROOTDIR to BFMDIR
SYSTEM v2.1
- activating the BFM_GOTM key now allows the use of the other bio models in gotm
  (modified bio_save.F90)
